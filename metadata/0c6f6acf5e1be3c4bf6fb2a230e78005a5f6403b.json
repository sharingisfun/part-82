While the bulk of the disc focuses on the mid- to late-'70s material of Bobby Byrd and the J.B.'s in particular, it hinges around the seminal 1980 &quot;Rap Payback (Where Iz Moses?)&quot; -- the song that opens and closes (with the 14-minute remix version) Funky Men. Released late in the year, it is a winning combination of funk mixed with a little proto-rap and, although it failed to make much of a splash in the U.S., where rap was rising thanks to Fatback Band's &quot;King Tim III&quot; and the Sugarhill Gang's &quot;Rappers Delight,&quot; it did quite well in the U.K. charts. \nAn additional highlight is the incredible funk groove of Byrd's &quot;Back From the Dead&quot; -- a solo venture recorded after he had parted company with Brown. Elsewhere, the contemporary, sharp disco of &quot;Just Wanna Make You Dance, Pt. 1,&quot; by the J.B.'s featuring Maxxi, and the quiet groove of the J.B.'s Internationals' &quot;Nature, Pts. 1 &amp; 2&quot; round out the mix nicely. And, of course, no compilation would be complete without a dance or two. Brown, Byrd, and the J.B.'s teamed up for a jamming 1980s rehash of &quot;Mashed Potatoes,&quot; which finds its way on board as well. \nAlthough it can be argued that Brown's earlier collaborations are his best, this is still a solid collection of late-in-the-day hits that have been cruelly overlooked in recent years.
