It consists primarily of reviews and reminiscences of pop-culture phenomena such as movies, video games, television programs, and comic books.\n\nBig Fan of the show but not a fan of the new daily format. I liked to be able to download one show at the end of the week with all the content in 1 single download. Why they don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t offer this at the end of the week is beyond me. \n\nEither way Im doing it myself every week and sharing it with you guys. I remove most ads I just leave the ads from the first and last show of the week. The ads after every daily episode is overkill IMO. Only 1 intro and outro removed them from each segment. I did this fast so im sure there are mistakes just point it out and i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll try to make sure I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t do it again next week. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll try to get these out every monday if the demand is high. Enjoy The Totally Rad Show Weekly. \n\nNerd is the new cool.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc394c2b34b6497896f06ddcb54708df38e69040","amp;dn":"The+totally+rad+show+Weekly+Week+9%2F19%2F10-9%2F23%2F10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc394c2b34b6497896f06ddcb54708df38e69040","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,57,76,43,52,182,73,120,150,240,109,220,181,71,8,223,56,230,144,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
