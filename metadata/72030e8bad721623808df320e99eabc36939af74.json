Unable to diagnose Alice, House becomes particularly motivated, as he's a fan of her books, and is convinced that the key to unlocking the mysteries of Alice's condition lies in the pages of her most recent novel. Meanwhile, House takes Cuddy on a double date with Wilson and his girlfriend, Sam, and makes a discovery that proves that life imitates art as the couple continues to make compromises in order to make their relationship work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 ****EOD****\n\n                         Even Firefighters need Heroes\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72030e8bad721623808df320e99eabc36939af74","amp;dn":"House+S07E03+Unwritten++++++EoD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72030e8bad721623808df320e99eabc36939af74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,3,14,139,173,114,22,35,128,141,243,32,233,158,171,195,105,57,175,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
