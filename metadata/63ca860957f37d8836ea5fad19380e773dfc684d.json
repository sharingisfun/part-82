So What?,&quot;[/url] for an analysis of the hideousness of the Clinton administration's sanctions policy against Iraq, and how that policy [i]inevitably and necessarily[/i] led to the Bush administration's criminal invasion of that country in 2003.\n\nFor identical reasons, punishing sanctions against Iran now so eagerly sought by the Obama administration will, in time, lead to the same result, if the policy remains unaltered. Yet many liberals and progressives again champion a strong sanctions policy as the [i]desirable[/i], supposedly &quot;peaceful&quot; and &quot;realistic&quot; alternative to war. But as shown inIran Gets Nukes&quot;[/url] and other essays here, [b]a sanctions regime is not an alternative to war: it is the prelude to attack or invasion. Moreover, sanctions murder a hideous number of innocent people as surely as more overt acts of war.[/b][/quote]     \n\n----- \n\n[b]TVO - The Agenda with Steve Paikin[/b]\n\n[i]The Agenda with Steve Paikin[/i] is TVO's flagship current affairs program - devoted to exploring the social, political, cultural and economic issues that are changing our world, at home and abroad.
