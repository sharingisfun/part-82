Much, though not all, of it consists of songs originating from County Sligo, where Burke's family had strong roots (although Burke himself was born in London). He varies the program from solo fiddle pieces to performances employing a variety of accompanists, the additional instrumentation including guitar, fiddle, mandolin, 12-string guitar, banjo, autoharp, and bodhran. It's a well-executed if unsurprising effort by a young fiddle virtuoso, reaching its greatest fever pitch on the closing &quot;George White's Favourite/The Happy Days of Youth/Coleman's Cross,&quot; where five instruments collaborate on an up-tempo tune to create a brisk, festive sound. \n \n \n1  Love at the Endings/John McGrath's Reel  Reavy  2:23  \n2  The Humours of Lissadell/Sweeney's Dream  Killoran  2:12  \n3  Murphy's Hornpipe   2:47  \n4  The Sligo Maid/The Woman of the House/The Sailor's Bonnet  Killoran  3:30  \n5  The Strayaway Child  Gorman  3:07  \n6  The College Groves   2:04  \n7  Toss the Feathers   2:54  \n8  The King of Fairies   2:46  \n9  The Mason's Apron/Laingston's Reel   2:36  \n10 The Bunch of Keys/The Girl That Broke My Heart  Crotty  3:04  \n11 Bonny Kate/Jenny's Chickens   3:06  \n12  Rise a Mile (Ride a Mile, Ride a Mule)   1:50  \n13 Brendan McGlinchey's Reel/Sweeney's Buttermilk  McGlinchey  2:29  \n14  Tuttle's Reel/The Chicken in the Saucepan   2:30  \n15  The Kid on the Mountain  Coleman  2:41  \n16  Gurren Castle/Finnea Lasses/The Long Note   3:17  \n17  George White's Favourite/The Happy Days of Youth/Coleman's Cross 3:15","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1394aee8a21b8b93fad5032d22053cd30b33769","amp;dn":"Kevin+Burke+-+Sweeney%5C%27s+Dream","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1394aee8a21b8b93fad5032d22053cd30b33769","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,57,74,238,138,33,184,185,63,173,80,50,210,32,83,205,48,179,55,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
