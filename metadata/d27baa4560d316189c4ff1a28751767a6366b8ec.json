The band was completed by Black Sabbath and Whitesnake bassist Neil Murray, drummer John Lingwood and vocalist Robert Hart from Bad Company and later British singer Gary Barden. \nAfter adding keyboardist Don Airey from Rainbow, the band went on tour, playing concerts almost completely consisting of old Whitesnake songs. Singer Barden left the band soon afterwards and was replaced by the Swedish Stefan Berggren. They toured throughout their history and released the live album Here They Go Again: the show was still sung by Barden, but his lead vocals were deleted and replaced in the studio by Berggren (2001)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d27baa4560d316189c4ff1a28751767a6366b8ec","amp;dn":"The+Company+Of+Snakes+-+Discography+%282001-2002%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d27baa4560d316189c4ff1a28751767a6366b8ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,123,170,69,96,211,22,24,156,79,241,162,135,81,118,122,99,102,184,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
