The journal has gained a worldwide reputation, demonstrated by its high ranking in the ISI Science Citation Index, as a forum for general and specialised communication between biophysicists working in different areas. The majority of reviews published are invited from authors who have made significant contributions to the field, who give critical, readable and sometimes controversial accounts of recent progress and problems in their speciality. Thematic issues are occasionally published.\n\n- journals.cambridge.org\n\nIssue 01:\npp. 1-55. Molecular structure of amyloid fibrils--insights from solid-state NMR\npp. 57-116. Computational biology in the study of cardiac ion channels and cell electrophysiology\n\nIssue 02:\npp. 117-166. Structural basis of function in heterotrimeric G proteins\npp. 167-201. Are amyloid diseases caused by protein aggregates that mimic bacterial pore-forming toxins\n\nIssue 03:\npp. 203-225. Mechanism of peptide bond formation on the ribosome\npp. 227-324. The architecture and function of the light-harvesting apparatus of purple bacteria--from single molecules to in vivo membranes\n\nIssue 04:\npp. 325-360. Determination of thermodynamics and kinetics of RNA reactions by force\npp. 361-396.
