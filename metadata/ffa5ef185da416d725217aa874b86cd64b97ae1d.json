Our music approaches the area of extreme metal, without restricting ourselves, with influences from the general rock/metal area and a touch of oriental elements. The lyrics are mainly of a radical political nature. In June 2009 we released our self-titled demo which is our first work. In July of the next year year Foivos Andriopoulos (drums) parted ways with the band. &quot;Seeds of Revolt&quot; is our second release. It is a demo-EP containing an intro, 6 new songs and a cover on &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; (MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead), and it was released on October 2010.  At the moment, we try to give as many concerts as possible, in order to gain experience being a new band, while a long-range aim is to present a full-length album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffa5ef185da416d725217aa874b86cd64b97ae1d","amp;dn":"Revolted+Masses+-+Seeds+of+Revolt+%28demo+EP%29+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffa5ef185da416d725217aa874b86cd64b97ae1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,165,239,24,93,164,22,215,37,33,122,168,116,184,108,214,75,151,174,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
