His first effort was The Great Rock and Roll Swindle, which was released in British cinemas on 15 May 1980. This earlier effort was heavily criticised for being too skewed towards the Pistols' manager Malcolm McLaren's version of events about the band. [citation needed]The Filth and the Fury tells the story from the viewpoint of the band members themselves (albeit in silhouette during their contemporary interviews).\nThe title of the film is a reference to a headline that appeared in the British tabloid newspaper The Daily Mirror after an interview on ITV's Today presented by Bill Grundy. (See EMI and the Grundy incident on the Sex Pistols main article.) The title of The Daily Mirror article was itself inspired by William Faulkner's novel The Sound and the Fury Temple's documentary charts the rise, decline and fall of the Sex Pistols from their humble beginnings in London's Shepherd's Bush to their disintegration at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. Temple puts the band into historical context with Britain's social situation in the 1970s through archival footage from the period. This film was seen in some ways as an opportunity for the Pistols to tell their side of the story, mostly through interviews with the surviving members of the group, footage shot during the era, and outtakes from The Great Rock and Roll Swindle.\n\n\nThe soundtrack to the film was released in 2002. The two-disc set contains songs by the Sex Pistols as well as music from other artists that was used in the film.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:580088317343213c5dc41dabf534774f327b92a8","amp;dn":"Sex+Pistols+-+The+Filth+and+the+Fury+-+320+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"580088317343213c5dc41dabf534774f327b92a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,0,136,49,115,67,33,60,93,196,29,171,245,52,119,79,50,123,146,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
