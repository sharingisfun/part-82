Stevens has no less than 30 U.K. Top 40 hits to his name, almost all of them racked up during one single five-year span of chart invincibility. Yet his recording career predated his first hit by over a decade, struggling through a period that might have forced any less committed artist to simply abandon all hope.\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nDISC 1:\n01.
