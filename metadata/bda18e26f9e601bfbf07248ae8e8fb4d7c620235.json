During his advance, he captures Sylvia, the niece of Roman Senator Fabius Maximus but, instead of holding her prisoner, he shows her his powerful army and herds of elephants, then sets her free. He is sure she will report what she has seen to his Roman enemies. Hannibal defeats the Romans at the battle of Trebbia and sends a message to Sylvia that he is marching on Rome. Sylvia succumbs to her love of Hannibal and they have a rendezvous, but are surprised by a Roman patrol. Hannibal escapes and Sylvia is confined to the temple of the Vesta Goddess. She escapes and meets Hannibal again. Hannibal orders his brother Hasdrubal to Carthage to take over command of the reinforcements preparing to join Hannibal. Hannibals wife Danila arrives from Carthage unexpectedly and Sylvia runs away and returns to Rome, where she is tried for high treason and sentenced to death. Hannibal continues to fight but he knows he will not succeed in destroying Rome.\n\nCast:\n \tVictor Mature \t... \tHannibal \n \tGabriele Ferzetti \t... \tFabius Maximus \n \tRita Gam \t... \tSylvia \n \tMilly Vitale \t... \tDanila \n \tRik Battaglia \t... \tHasdrubal \n \tFranco Silva \t... \tMaharbal \n \tTerence Hill \t... \tQuintilius (as Mario Girotti) \n \tMirko Ellis \t... \tMago \n \tAndrea Aureli \t... \tGajus Terentius Varro \n \tAndrea Fantasia \t... \tKonsul Paulus Emilius\t\t\n \tBud Spencer \t... \tRutario (as Carlo Pedersoli)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bda18e26f9e601bfbf07248ae8e8fb4d7c620235","amp;dn":"%5B1960%5D+HANNIBAL+%28Annibale%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bda18e26f9e601bfbf07248ae8e8fb4d7c620235","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,161,142,38,249,230,1,191,191,7,36,138,232,232,251,77,124,98,2,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
