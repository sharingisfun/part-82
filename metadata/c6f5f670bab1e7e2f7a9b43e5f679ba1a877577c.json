A team of American scientists residing in the Antarctic are unwittingly exposed to an alien creature that lives in any living organism. After the creature kills off most of the scientists, the remaining two men decide to blow up the entire camp to keep wipe it out completely. Players take on the role of a specialist Search and Rescue leader who's been sent to uncover the mysterious deaths of the previous US team. Players explore the destroyed station and fend of creatures while facing several dynamics, such as handling the freezing cold and a trust/fear system. \n\n\nMinimum: \nPentium II 400 MHz, 64 MB RAM, Windows 98/ME/XP, DirectX 8.0, DirectX compliant video card, DirectX compliant sound card, 4x CD-ROM drive, 600 MB hard-disk space \n\n\nmore info and screens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.esoft.in/games/204138-thing.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.esoft.in/games/204138-thing.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6f5f670bab1e7e2f7a9b43e5f679ba1a877577c","amp;dn":"The+Thing+Horror+PC+Game+%5BAwesome%21%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6f5f670bab1e7e2f7a9b43e5f679ba1a877577c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,245,246,112,186,177,231,226,247,169,180,62,95,103,155,161,168,119,87,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
