I hope I am getting better at this!\n\nThis is for sampling purposes only.  It is out of print as is Mortal's\nstuff, so if you like this I advise you to try to support the artist\nin any way including but not limited to buying Fold Zandura albums\nthat are not out of print.\n\n\n*************\n\n\nDinner is ready so I have to go eat so I must make this short and sweet.\n\nMortal was a Christian industrial band that showed up in the early 90's.\nTheir sound was very similar to Ministry's early albums.  They began to\nchange their sound on the album &quot;Wake&quot; to a more melodic (but still heavy)\nalternative sound.  They went on to release another album or two but then\nthey created Fold Zandura.  Same band members, different persona.  Very\nmelodic, atmospheric, dreamy whispery vocals etc.  Really good stuff to\nmake out with your girlfriend to.  This is the original 1995 release\n(Windows Media Player wants to call it 1996 but I am holding the original\ncopy that I acquired years ago dated 1995; trust me, it's 1995).\n\nAnyone got Mortal's Nu-En-Jin?  I need it badly!\n\n\n*************\n\n\nI also highly recommend the bands Mortal and Starflyer59 if you like Fold Zandura.\n\nEnjoy &amp; please seed!\n\n\n*************\n\nYours truly\n\nFLAC the Ripper\n\nDon't mind me giving the trade name\n\n*************&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2e48424f4d5a464b5c475e5e4b5c6e494356004d4143&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;*************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0dc661edf749f4171d22b6ca8d4adb0d6cc8d75","amp;dn":"Fold+Zandura+formerly+Mortal+%281995%29+MP3+%40+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0dc661edf749f4171d22b6ca8d4adb0d6cc8d75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,220,102,30,223,116,159,65,113,210,43,108,168,212,173,176,214,204,141,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
