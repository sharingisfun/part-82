Chapman became a stockbroker in 1960 and retired in 1988. For 18 of those years he owned his own brokerage firm and was probably the largest gold and silver stockbroker in the world during that period. Starting in 1967 Mr. Chapman began writing articles on business, finance, economics and politics having been printed and reprinted over the years in over 200 publications. He owned and wrote the Gary Allen Report, which had 30,000 subscribers. \n[from 6:00 in the 1st half of hour 3, through 16:00 in the 2nd half of that hour]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://intforecaster.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://intforecaster.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlex also covers the latest news and takes calls.\n\n\n\n[I don't have the most recent issue of Bob Chapman's newsletter to pass along as a bonus today. Rather that including nothing extra, though, I'm adding a recent article by Web of Debt author, Ellen Brown.  This essay is titled, &quot;How Brokers Became Bookies: The Insidious Transformation of Markets into Casinos.&quot;]\n\n\n\n..........\n\nfolder.jpg courtesy of commenter &quot;Nighted&quot; at the sebaygo1 blog\n..........\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_torrents_info_PLEASE-READ.txt\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
