Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible-inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/&lt;/a&gt;\nMOVIEmeter: Up 300% in popularity this week.\nUser Rating:Top 250: #3 (register to vote) 9.3/10\n\n\n \nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\nMuxing mode : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 2h 14mn\nBit rate : 1 321 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 304 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.35\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nResolution : 24 bits\nColorimetry : 4:2:0\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.241\nStream size : 1.24 GiB (87%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 2h 14mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\nStream size : 185 MiB (13%)\nAlignment : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\n\nNOTES:\n\nIMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Inception \n\nSource used was ORC's homemade video + audio......Thanks guys \nNow the source was nice but suffered from two major things....camera movement and flicker.\nNow the flicker only happens a few times and not for long......the bad news is the cammer had ants in his pants \nGot to give orc credit for having the balls to go and do it,so fair play lads .\nRight all we've done for this is done a small script to resize,white balance,rgbeq,contrast,brightness and sharpen.\nNothing as been done to the angles or camera movement.....just too bad to do anything decent to it.\nThe screens below so the good and bad of this release so ....take it or leave.\n\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.com/image/20000/19460.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.com/image/20000/19460.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21c913532c4fd82dff9cef189d1dce2b4a031423","amp;dn":"Inception+TS+READNFO+V2++XViD+-+IMAGiNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21c913532c4fd82dff9cef189d1dce2b4a031423","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,201,19,83,44,79,216,45,255,156,239,24,157,29,206,43,74,3,20,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
