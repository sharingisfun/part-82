The journal has gained a worldwide reputation, demonstrated by its high ranking in the ISI Science Citation Index, as a forum for general and specialised communication between biophysicists working in different areas. The majority of reviews published are invited from authors who have made significant contributions to the field, who give critical, readable and sometimes controversial accounts of recent progress and problems in their speciality. Thematic issues are occasionally published.\n\n- journals.cambridge.org\n\nIssue 01:\npp. 1-62. Photosynthetic apparatus of purple bacteria\npp. 63-87.
