Following the events of the original Tron, the year is 1983 and Kevin Flynn is now in charge of Encom. He's built it into the largest videogame company in the world. But that's not all Kevin has accomplished - he's also secretly built the Grid, a digital world filled with living programs! More than a place where he can race light cycles, it's a place where he can build and test environments only limited by his imagination. But the Grid is far more complex than even its creator realizes, and even Flynn can't be in two places at once. As this new world develops a life of its own, Flynn is going to first need the help of an old friend, a security program named Tron. Showcasing a key time of the mythology of the Tron world, part one of THE BETRAYAL will show the early days of the Grid, and the first appearances of the heroes and villains that will be seen in Tron: Legacy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbbb7317ec9a520e905490d890220a0d58f9e915","amp;dn":"TRON%3A+The+Betrayal+01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbbb7317ec9a520e905490d890220a0d58f9e915","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,187,115,23,236,154,82,14,144,84,144,216,144,34,10,13,88,249,233,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
