Dr. Eli Watt is played by Lionel who returns to his home town in farm country and starts up practice after not being successful and returns with his son, Joel McCrea,(Jimmy Watt). Eli Watt finds that the local people in town cannot afford to pay a doctor and bargain with potatoes, squash and everything else but money. There is a patient who gives birth to a baby girl, however, the mother dies and the husband does not want his baby girl and threatens to kill the doctor. So Eli Watt decides to raise the baby girl who is later played by Frances Dee,(Joan Stockton). This is a very enjoyable film showing how country doctors operated years and years ago. \n\nLionel Barrymore\t\tDr. Eli Watt\nMay Robson\t\t\tSarah\nDorothy Jordan\t\t\tLetty McGinnis\nJoel McCrea\t\t\tJimmy Watt\nFrances Dee\t\t\tJoan Stockton\n\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Simple@L3\n      Format settings, BVOP : No\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 12mn\n      Bit rate : 1 217 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.132\n      Stream size : 629 MiB (90%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 12mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 116 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 59.9 MiB (9%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.72 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 493 ms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e7dcfef4113745386fec0f7ee99588cf1dfdf09","amp;dn":"One+Man%5C%27s+Journey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e7dcfef4113745386fec0f7ee99588cf1dfdf09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,125,207,239,65,19,116,83,134,254,192,247,238,153,88,140,241,223,223,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
