Instantly \nrecognizable from its harsh drum machine introduction, which leads into \nminimalist synthesizer lines in minor keys and finally Phil Collins' \nreverb-laden voice, &quot;Mama&quot; serves notice that the album which follows will be \nconsiderably darker than previous efforts. The song's theme involves a young \nman's longing for a particular prostitute. It remains the band's biggest \ncommercial success in the UK, reaching #4 on the UK Singles Chart. It also made \nthe top 10 in Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Ireland and the Netherlands. It was \nless popular in the US, only reaching #73 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n(video has a semi-transparent white &quot;WDR&quot; logo at the top right)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mama_(Genesis_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mama_(Genesis_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6790kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Media Length: 00:03:06\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
