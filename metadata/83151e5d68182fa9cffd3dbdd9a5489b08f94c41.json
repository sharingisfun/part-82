As the action unfolds, Pastor Hagee appears periodically to relate the on screen action to the Word of God so that he might explain how each scene is prophesied by the Bible, and how one might avoid being one of those left behind.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.christiancinema.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=23&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.christiancinema.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=23&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlz seed as long as possible...\n\nUploaded by Abraham","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83151e5d68182fa9cffd3dbdd9a5489b08f94c41","amp;dn":"Vanished%28Christian+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83151e5d68182fa9cffd3dbdd9a5489b08f94c41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,21,30,93,104,24,47,169,207,253,61,189,217,165,72,155,8,249,76,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
