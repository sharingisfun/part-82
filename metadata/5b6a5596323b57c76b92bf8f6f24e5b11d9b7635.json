That personalization is one of Art Alexakis's greatest gifts to postgrunge rock; rather than float generalized rage over the ever-growing roar of his power trio, he tells you his stories, those of the people around him, some he makes up--and makes them all yours in the end. The development in the music here, from the Beach Boys-style chorale at the top of the title cut to the new wavey jerkiness of &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot; and &quot;Normal Like You,&quot; boasts of not only the band's surefootedness but Alexakis's own generosity. The latter is best reflected in &quot;Father of Mine,&quot; one of the saddest, most brutal songs about family ever. --Rickey Wright\n\nRipped using Exact Audio Copy with AccurateRip (all OK), encoded with dbPowerAmp Music Converter on &quot;High&quot; setting for FLAC, tagged with Tag&amp;Rename from Amazon source.
