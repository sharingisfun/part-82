It was released on June 22, 2010 by Octone Records via the iTunes Store. The song was released in advance of the band's mid-2010 tour, and is the first single from their third studio album, Hands All Over, which will be released on September 21, 2010.\n\nWritten by Adam Levine, Jesse Carmichael, and Sam Farrar, the song is about the vocalist of the group finding himself in a difficult situation when a relationship fades. &quot;Why won't you answer me? / Your silence is slowly killing me / Girl you really got me bad.&quot;, he states in the lyrics.\n\nLevine stated to MTV News that the song's music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, will focus on violence, rather than sex, where the female lead attempts to kill her lover. The video premiered on July 1 on MTV and VH1.\n\nMTV Buzzworthy stated that the single was &quot;pretty classic Maroon 5&quot;, and &quot;a buoyant, poppy affair that has a dark underbelly.&quot; AOL Radio stated that it was a &quot;falsetto-pleading, yet upbeat, keyboard-popping track&quot; with a chorus similar to Maroon 5's 2004 single &quot;This Love&quot;. The New York Post stated that the single was &quot;exactly the kind of up tempo, falsetto-filled single we've come to expect&quot;. Rolling Stone reviewers called the song a &quot;funk-rock singalong&quot; that &quot;some people might have a hard time picking out... from a police line-up of Maroon 5 songs.&quot;\n\nHands All Over is the upcoming third studio album by American band Maroon 5. The album is set to be released by A&amp;M/Octone on September 21, 2010. One single, &quot;Misery&quot; has been released from the album so far, released on June 22nd, 2010.\n\nMaroon 5 is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California. While they were in high school, vocalist and rhythm guitarist Adam Levine, keyboardist Jesse Carmichael, base guitarist Mickey Madden, and drummer Ryan Dusick formed a garage band called Kara's Flowers in 1995 and released one album in 1997. They reformed, with guitarist James Valentine, in 2001 and pursued a new direction as Maroon 5. The following year they released their debut album Songs About Jane, which contained four hit singles: &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;, &quot;This Love&quot;, &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; and &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;; it also enjoyed major chart success, going gold, platinum, and triple platinum in many countries around the world.\n\nIn support of Songs About Jane, Maroon 5 toured extensively throughout 2003ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2005, during which time two live albums were released. They received the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. Dusick left the band in September 2006, citing injuries sustained by constant touring, and was replaced by Matt Flynn. Maroon 5's second studio album It Won't Be Soon Before Long was released in 2007, with the singles &quot;Makes Me Wonder&quot;, &quot;Won't Go Home Without You&quot; and &quot;Wake Up Call&quot;. The band performed live in two tours between June and November 2007, during which time a compilation of previously unreleased songs, The B-Side Collection, was released.\n\nTwo more live albums and a remix album were issued in 2008. Maroon 5's third studio album is scheduled to be released in September 2010. Since debuting in 2002, the band has sold over 10 million albums in the United States and nearly 15 million worldwide.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:124792037a931e60ff4cd60a04b9e5964e97579e","amp;dn":"Maroon+5+-+Misery++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"124792037a931e60ff4cd60a04b9e5964e97579e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,71,146,3,122,147,30,96,255,76,214,10,4,185,229,150,78,151,87,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
