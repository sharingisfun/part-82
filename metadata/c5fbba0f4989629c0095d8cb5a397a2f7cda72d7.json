Tina's husband Moose  \n                    was sent down when their daughter Jess was only  \n                    six months old. Carrying the can for someone  \n                    else's crime, Moose was sentenced to eight  \n                    years, went off the rails and left Tina and  \n                    Jess to manage on their own. Some time later  \n                    Tina got together with security guard Adam -  \n                    he's kind, reliable and the only dad Jess has  \n                    ever known. So when Moose leaves prison Tina  \n                    does everything she can to keep him away -  \n                    Moose blew his rights eight years ago and she's  \n                    with Adam now. Even if Tina can keep Moose away  \n                    from the house, will she be able to keep him  \n                    out of her head, and can water ever be thicker  \n                    than blood?                              \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5fbba0f4989629c0095d8cb5a397a2f7cda72d7","amp;dn":"Moving.On.S02E04.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5fbba0f4989629c0095d8cb5a397a2f7cda72d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,251,186,15,73,137,98,156,0,149,216,203,90,57,122,47,124,218,114,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
