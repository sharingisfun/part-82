In part, that's due to ex-Beatles producer George Martin, whose considerable studio expertise nudged country-ish tunes like &quot;Sister Golden Hair&quot; as close to power pop as they were feasibly going to get. But the fact is that America had a genuine knack for crafting catchy, radio-ready singles, and this album offers just about all of them, including the Neil Young-esque &quot;Horse With No Name,&quot; and the genuinely lovely &quot;Ventura Highway.&quot;\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
