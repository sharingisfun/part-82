Willie Buck has been leading bands in the city for over forty years and this material was committed for posterity some twenty eight years ago. Passing time hasn't diminished it however and it sounds as uplifting now as it would have done back then. \nThe last five tracks were recorded live. What they lack in audio sophistication is more than compensated for by their immediacy and fire. Recorded in Chicago back in 1984 they are in summary further testament to no holds barred blues. \n\nTrack Listing:\n1 She's All Right; \n2 How Can I Be Nice To You?; \n3 I Live The Life I Love; \n4 I've Got A Right To Love My Baby; \n5 Champagne And Reefer; \n6 There's A Time; \n7 Everything's Gonna Be Alright; \n8 Sweet Sixteen; \n9 Found My Baby Gone; \n10 Nineteen Years Old; \n11 I Want You To Love Me; \n12 Got My Mojo Workin'; \n13 Sugar Sweet; \n14 Don't Go No Further; \n15 Checkin' Up On My Baby; \n16 Just To Be With You; \n17 Blues Had A Baby. \n\n\nPersonnel:\nWillie Buck: vocals; Louis Myers: guitar; Little Mac Simmons: harmonica; Big Moose Walker: keyboards; Dave Myers: bass; Jerry Porter: drums (1-12) Jodie North: drums (13-17) John Primer: guitar (1-12); Dimestore Fred: harmonica (2, 3, 5, 6, 8-12).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc1b1805a17baf752388498c906549e2cf999b12","amp;dn":"Willie+Buck+The+Life+I+Love%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc1b1805a17baf752388498c906549e2cf999b12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,27,24,5,161,123,175,117,35,136,73,140,144,101,73,226,207,153,155,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
