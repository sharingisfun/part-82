Out back, host Kevin OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Connor finds\ngeneral contractor Tom Silva and lead paint specialist Ron Peik demolishing the sun porch\nwithin the limits of the new national EPA lead law that now affects all contractors working\non houses from 1978 or earlier. Master carpenter Norm Abram and homeowner Allison\nSharma learn more about the grand estate that once occupied the neighborhood by visiting\nits original gatehouse, which is now a private home. Tom shows Kevin the progress on the\nexcavation out front and out back, where Tom has transferred the load from the rear wall of\nthe house, inbound, to a series of three temporary walls so work can begin. A team of\nconcrete cutters arrives to set up and begin the process of cutting through the 10ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ thick\nconcrete foundation walls. After the final cuts are made, they drop out a 16ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½foot section of\nthe rear foundation wall to make way for the new family room addition.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f72c00e1036c91ad8130b9bc045662e9f4ccef88","amp;dn":"This.Old.House-Auburndale.Project-S30E02.AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f72c00e1036c91ad8130b9bc045662e9f4ccef88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,44,0,225,3,108,145,173,129,48,185,188,4,86,98,233,244,204,239,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
