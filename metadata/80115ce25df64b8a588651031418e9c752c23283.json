In New York City, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) discovers transmissions that he believes the aliens use as a timer to coordinate their attack.\n\nOn July 3, the United States counterattacks; the Black Knights, a squadron of Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets, attack a destroyer near the remains of Los Angeles. Their weapons fail to penetrate the craft's force field, and it releases scores of smaller &quot;attacker&quot; ships which are armed with similar shields and weaponry; a one-sided dogfight  ensues. Hiller survives by luring an attacker to the Grand Canyon,[4]  where he causes it to crash and then subdues the alien pilot. Hiller is picked up by Russell Casse. They take the captured alien to Area 51, where the President and his staff have landed. Area 51 conceals a top secret facility housing a repaired attacker and three alien bodies recovered from Roswell in 1947, revealing that the aliens were also responsible for the Incident.\n\nOn July 4, David devises a plan to use the repaired attacker to gain access to the interior of the mothership in order to introduce a computer virus and plant a nuclear bomb. It is hoped that this will cause the shields of the Earth-based alien craft to fail long enough for a worldwide attack to eliminate them. Hiller volunteers to be the mission's pilot, with David accompanying him to upload the virus. Hiller and Jasmine are married with David and Constance as witnesses. With few pilots to man available aircraft, the battle requires volunteers, including Whitmore and Russell, who have previous combat flight experience. Morse code is used to contact armies around the world in order to coordinate the attack without raising the aliens' suspicions.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/48871709044205955768.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/48871709044205955768.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/85689060946400750019.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/85689060946400750019.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/64568963807077671860.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/64568963807077671860.png&lt;/a&gt;\nDirected by Roland Emmerich\nProduced by Dean Devlin\nWritten by Dean Devlin\nRoland Emmerich\nStarring Will Smith\nBill Pullman\nJeff Goldblum\nMary McDonnell\nMargaret Colin\nVivica A.
