Starlet Chelsea Sennett and her mom Trudy screech up to Edison, the club of the moment, to hundreds of paparazzi flashes. Manager Nick Manto gets them situated, then points Chelsea in the direction of handsome young actor Colin Blakely. Within minutes, Chelsea and Colin are making out, while Colin's girlfriend Melinda is home alone, and hearing odd noises. She makes a run for it, but her assailant beats her around the face with a pillowcase filled with the booty he's just stolen, leaving her bloody and unconscious on the floor. The next morning, LAPD detectives TJ Jaruszalski and Rex Winters investigate the scene as a battered Melinda recovers from her skull fracture in the hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 ****EOD****\n\n                         Even Firefighters need Heroes\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d04a999714736a72bc9f7536c22293e9987cf3a0","amp;dn":"Law+%26+Order%3A+Los+Angeles+S01E01+Hollywood+++++++++EoD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d04a999714736a72bc9f7536c22293e9987cf3a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,74,153,151,20,115,106,114,188,159,117,54,194,34,147,233,152,124,243,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
