There was always something unique\nand interesting about this band that has kept fans enthralled for over two\ndecades. Whether it was the intensity of their live performances or the haunting\nmelodies &amp; lyrical content, this group radiated a passion and emotion that\nstruck a chord in the hearts of misunderstood youth all over the world. Perhaps,\nit was the underlying message of strength, hidden within the group's tales of\ndespair that made such an impact on people. For most listeners, understanding\nthat the songs came from a genuine place, based on actual experiences made the\nmessage really hit home, that they were not alone.\nNew York's crossover legends Life Of Agony spawned in the Summer of 1989,\ntearing through the underground scene with an undeterred aggression, obtaining a\nloyal and devoted cult audience in the process. The outfit caught Roadrunner\nRecordsÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9a6fc3ff28c81df8a06bb5a9e38ab95bf4862dd","amp;dn":"Life_Of_Agony_-_20_Years_Strong_%28River_Runs_Red_Live_In_Brussels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9a6fc3ff28c81df8a06bb5a9e38ab95bf4862dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,166,252,63,242,140,129,223,138,6,187,90,158,56,171,149,191,72,98,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
