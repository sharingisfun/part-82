Chuck Missler is the Best Instructor of Prophecy on The Planet, which we will be leaving soon. Line by Line Missler literally explains what is in store for the World. There are about 500 prophesies yet to be fulfilled. This will be interesting as 2000 prophesies have already been fulfilled. Do you think the last 500 will come to pass? If you had a racing form at the Race Track that had predicted the winner of 2000 horse races in a row, would you bet on the 2001 race the racing form predicted the winner? I think so, if not you are a fool!\n\n\n\nDAYS OF DANIEL'S 70TH WEEK\n1st Day\n\nPeace covenant between Israel and enemies arranged by America, Daniel 9:27, Revelation 6:2, 8:1.

They will be warning the Jews of the imminent Russian-Syrian invasion. Their ministry will be during both halves of the 70th Week because of Revelation 11:6, which shows God's judgement of water to blood, which occurs in last half; and Revelation 11:10, which shows world rejoicing at the death of two witnesses. If they ministered only in the last half, the world would be terrified and mourning at sight of returning Lord, not rejoicing. If they minister only first half, how can waters turn to blood, which is God's wrath? Witnesses preach against beast and harlot church and for the coming of Jesus in power and glory. Jesus comes in 1,651 days.\n\nDays of religious, political deception (world peace) will be shortened or elect would be deceived.

Jesus comes in 1,260 days.\n\nWrath of God meets wrath of Satan for 1,260 days. Days of Great Tribulation and days of Jacob's Trouble.

Jesus first destroys all world's armies at Armageddon, who have been gathered by beast and false prophet to fight against Him, thinking He is an alien invading force, Revelation 1:7, 19:11-21. Satan is cast into the bottomless pit for 1,000 years, Revelation 20:1-3. All saints who were in Heaven come with Jesus. Judgement of surviving people of the nations begins.
