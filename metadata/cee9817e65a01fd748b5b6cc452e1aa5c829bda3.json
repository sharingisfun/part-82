An IP address is an Internet Protocol address, a unique identifying number. It is used to identify all the different computers and websites on the Internet, and it could be used to track your communications with all websites or programs that connect to the Internet. This is known as Direct Internet Connection.\n\nIf you run Platinum Hide IP on your computer, it will modify your Internet Connection Settings and use an anonymous Proxy Server which acts as an intermediary between a home network and the rest of the Internet and makes requests for Internet information on your behalf, using its own IP address instead of yours.\n\nPlatinum Hide IP is compatible with many web browsers such as Internet Explorer, FireFox, Opera, Maxthon, MyIE browsers.  All websites visited or E-mails sent using these browsers will show you are connecting from one of our fake IP addresses.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.platinumhideip.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.platinumhideip.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cee9817e65a01fd748b5b6cc452e1aa5c829bda3","amp;dn":"Platinum.Hide.IP3.0.3.2.with+crack.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cee9817e65a01fd748b5b6cc452e1aa5c829bda3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,233,129,126,101,160,31,215,72,181,182,204,69,46,26,165,200,41,189,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
