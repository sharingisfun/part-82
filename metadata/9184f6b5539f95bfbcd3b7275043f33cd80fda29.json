This is probably the one I'd go for (though &quot;Searchlight&quot; and &quot;The Cutter and the Clan&quot; give it a good run for its money). This is the MacDonald brothers at their most moody and atmospheric - the songs are driven by brooding guitars and percussion, with keyboards adding just the right note of broodiness or whimsy according to the song. The opening bars of &quot;Headlights&quot; are like watching a storm roll in over the hills at night, and the scene-painting continues right to the end of the album. Stand-out tracks for me are &quot;This Beautiful Pain&quot; (because it clicked with me, somehow), &quot;I'll Keep Coming Home&quot; (delightfully understated) and the gorgeous &quot;Always the Winner&quot; - which, in sentiment if not necessarily in melody, is perhaps the most uplifting song the band have ever written.
