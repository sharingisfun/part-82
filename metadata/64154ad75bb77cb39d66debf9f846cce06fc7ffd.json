After teaching myself the basics of stop-motion, &quot;Reckless Zen&quot; was shot over 4weeks on a zero budget, with an Olympus u700w still camera, and using recycled materials. \n\nPost production was completed in After Effects, and Final Cut Studio.\n\nFeaturing music by DaNnyand narrated by Surina Kelly (www.myradio1.ae), Reckless Zen is a story about taking chances, and dreaming big... even if you are made of wood.\n\nSee stills, the production diary, and the birth of the film at www.recklesszen.org\n\nThis film was made through the use of Creative Commons.
