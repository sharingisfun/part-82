It emphasizes mathematical structures, modelling and abstraction as a basis for programming, introducing students to formal methods concepts early. The authors concentrate on the basics of program design rather than on the design of efficient algorithms. The book has a dual purpose, firstly to teach program design based on a set of simple, clean &amp; powerful concepts and secondly to teach the fundamental concepts of computer science in an informal but precise way.&quot;\n\n\nThis is my first bookscan using the technique described here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.instructables.com/id/Bargain-Price-Book-Scanner-From-A-Cardboard-Box/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.instructables.com/id/Bargain-Price-Book-Scanner-From-A-Cardboard-Box/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAs it is my first, expect some errors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79779481af1c4ff825e677c74c5821cea879ff6e","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+programming+using+SML","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79779481af1c4ff825e677c74c5821cea879ff6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,119,148,129,175,28,79,248,37,230,119,199,76,88,33,206,168,121,255,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
