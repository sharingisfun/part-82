Due to the translation of Mayan writing, discoveries of calendar inscriptions at Mayan ruins and the availability of scientific facts about Earth history, we now have the answer to the Mayan calendar mystery.\n\nIan Xel Lungold presents scientific evidence that demonstrates that the Maya centered their civilization around the actual schedule of the evolution of consciousness and the unfolding of creation, galaxies, life and history, in a system of repeating, ever accelerating cycles.\n\nTotal time: 5 hours, 30 minutes\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mayanmajix.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mayanmajix.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPart 1: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-489786527478456160#\n\n\nPart 2: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2832986272853534626#\n\n\nPart 3: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4471242431596979951#\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4582e260971d7126f4731ceeaf2c248e5100ae6e","amp;dn":"Secrets+of+the+Mayan+Calendar+Unveiled+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4582e260971d7126f4731ceeaf2c248e5100ae6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,130,226,96,151,29,113,38,244,115,28,238,175,44,36,142,81,0,174,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
