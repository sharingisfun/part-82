Thanks to both top guys for the video and audio thanks to both!... 1st it was to make .avs scripts for the video files, each file had different angles and contained some slight camera movement... so i used 3 different angle filters on each file to fix it different ways to get them correct... theirs still some camera movement but really nothing to worry about... then it was a case of fixing the noise, used a denoise filter a smoothness filter on a really low setting. After that it was onto the colors, now they changed throughout, from yellow to red vice versa, filtered it all to what i thought looked pretty good... then added a simple but effective sharpness script just to tighten the edges up a little. Fixed the resolution to what i thought looked best for the source. The audio had some little noise and a few small problems Which we fixed. Used a Stereo Filter, Noise Filter, Wave Hammer, Dynamic Processor And some other stuff :) Anyway Subtitles are already Hardcoded English on source for the foreign parts :). Theirs still some noise on the audio... but we filtered it enough not to add any more... but most is gone :) Hope you Enjoy alot of work and hours into this one ;)\n\ncredit PrisM &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, IPTORRENTS, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic, FASAMOO, W1CK3D1NT3Z, GRIND3R, extremezone, MonsterTV, BLaZE, SAFCuk009, Fabreezy, MXMG, Hellb0y, iwanttobelieveinaj, velvetfog, mustaphanaru &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img814.imageshack.us/img814/7097/2djx5w6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img814.imageshack.us/img814/7097/2djx5w6.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img188.imageshack.us/img188/7356/erkjo2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img188.imageshack.us/img188/7356/erkjo2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/5716/v7qv47.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/5716/v7qv47.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img192.imageshack.us/img192/3530/fnajyd.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img192.imageshack.us/img192/3530/fnajyd.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/188/dct3jd.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/188/dct3jd.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/6474/2dqsnsm.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/6474/2dqsnsm.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/4149/ins5f9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/4149/ins5f9.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img807.imageshack.us/img807/3857/fus390.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img807.imageshack.us/img807/3857/fus390.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDON'T THANK US...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0985694/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0985694/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5f416c5edd51686134a381344854f88c6ac74c5","amp;dn":"Machete.2010.TS.XviD-PrisM%28READ+NOTES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5f416c5edd51686134a381344854f88c6ac74c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,244,22,197,237,213,22,134,19,74,56,19,68,133,79,136,198,172,116,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
