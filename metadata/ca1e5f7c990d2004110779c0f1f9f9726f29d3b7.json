The driver, Gordy, an awkward young itinerant who eyed her in the diner earlier, isn't displeased to find this pretty sylph in his front seat. Soon they meet Brett, a laconic, humble man just released from prison. Martine isn't keen on going solo with Gordy, and now it's raining cats and dogs, so she invites Brett along, and the unlikely trio sets out, each person unsure of the destination. What ensues is a journey through the lush green byways of rural Louisiana and into the depths of these characters' souls.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca1e5f7c990d2004110779c0f1f9f9726f29d3b7","amp;dn":"The.Yellow.Handkerchief.2008.DVDRiP.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca1e5f7c990d2004110779c0f1f9f9726f29d3b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,30,95,124,153,13,32,4,17,7,121,192,241,249,249,114,111,41,211,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
