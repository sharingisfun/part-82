Our government has already spent thirteen trillion more dollars than it has taxes to cover. Tonight's show (FBN @ 9pm ET) is all about why we're bankrupting America and what we can do about it.\n\nThe future looks ugly. The deficit spending is unsustainable. At the rate government spends and makes promises, government will soon consume... everything.\n\nMost Americans agree that government spending is a problem but ... they don't want to cut anything significant.  No cuts to Social Security. Or Medicare. Or the Military. Many have no clue that those programs are most of the budget. And if voters don't have the guts to make these cuts, the politicians sure won't.\n\nSo, where do we start? What should we cut? I'll lay out my suggestions on tonight's show, but check out the cuts offered by these think tanks from all over the political spectrum.\n\nThird Way has some ideas that I like, including this proposal for a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtaxpayer's receiptÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that lets you see how much of your money goes where.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation suggests hard spending caps on Congress.\n\nThe Center for American Progress identified $255 Billion in cuts, and I'd take them all, although all their cuts wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be enough.\n\nThe Cato Institute offers more cuts. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve identified nearly $500 Billion in cuts at downsizinggovernment.org and they are only halfway through the budget.\n\nThis month's issue of Reason magazine has a good summary of budget-cut ideas (partly in 3D, if you like that sort of thing).\n\nTonight weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll discuss possible cuts, and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll fight with some pro-union folks, who say that public sector unions are wonderful .\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ca879c221921dd73eb2f7e155e8dd3b8811fdeb","amp;dn":"20101007-Stossel-%5BBankrupting+America%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ca879c221921dd73eb2f7e155e8dd3b8811fdeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,168,121,194,33,146,29,215,62,178,247,225,85,232,221,59,136,17,253,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
