At first 'the Dream' was modest  a 2 bedroom dwelling in the    \n     suburbs just like everyone elses, with enough land for a vegie     \n              patch and a spot for the kids to play.\n\nBut              \n    then the population exploded, the suburbs sprawled, the fashions     \n   changed, and 'the Dream' did too. Today a 'modest' Australian home    \n     is at least twice the size of the post-war model. It used to be     \n     possible to buy a house for three times your annual salary, now     \n      it's nine times. And where once &quot;home&quot; was about shelter and       \n    security, now it's also a means of accumulating wealth and status    \n         for which many are finding it impossible to pay.\n\nIn          \n     this episode a cross-section of Australians tell stories of the     \n      Australian Dream; Olive and Roger still live in the tiny home      \n   Roger built with hand tools when the war ended 65 years ago; Carol    \n    has lived in a succession of renovated houses before finding her     \n      'dream home', but a life-long contact with asbestos building       \n     materials has resulted in a life-threatening illness; Kevin in      \n     outback New South Wales tells us he was the first aborigine to      \n      receive funding to build a house, a tiny weatherboard cottage      \n    which has been 'home' for he and his wife, their eight kids and a    \n    plethora of relatives and friends; Sophia and Joe reflect on how     \n    their dream to profit from owning multiple properties turned into    \n    a nightmare in which they lost everything; and 90 year old Dolly,    \n    whos rented all her life, reminds us that you dont have to own     \n            it, to live in your 'dream home'.\n\nRemarkably,             \n     no matter how high the prices go, the Australian Dream endures.     \n    Successive Australian Governments have kept it alive by providing    \n   special grants to first home buyers and generous tax incentives to    \n                          new investors.\n\nBut                          \n        there are 22 million people in Australian today and were        \n   struggling to accommodate them. Predictions are that in 2050 there    \n    will be close to 40 million, and no doubt most of them will have     \n                    ambitions to own their own home.                     \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.abc.net.au/tv/makingaustralia/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.abc.net.au/tv/makingaustralia/&lt;/a&gt;                \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                \n             \n                                                                           \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                            \n                                                                    \n                                             \n                                              \n                                                      \n                                                         \n                                    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n                \n                                                                  \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n            Prob get nuked for some lame ass reason!
