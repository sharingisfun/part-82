In the Internet age, newspapers and magazines face near extinction. Newsrooms are shrinking, with foreign bureaus hardest hit. With the rise of blogs, in-depth coverage is being replaced by opinion. If current trends continue, we can expect that in ten years most news organizations will be fully devoted to a round-the-clock regurgitation of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œinfo-tainment.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nWith the loss of real journalism comes the loss of knowledge and understanding. A healthy and democratic nation will not be able to function, let alone flourish, on this diet of limited information.\n\nREPORTER is a feature documentary about Nicholas Kristof, the two-time Pulitzer Prize winning columnist for the New York Times, who almost single-handedly put the crisis in Darfur on the world map. The film puts the viewer in KristofÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pocket, revealing the man and his methods, and just how and why real reporting is vital to our democracy, our world-awareness, and our capacity to be a force for good. But REPORTER has a second agenda. By tracking a newsman, we track his news.\nIn the summer of 2007, Kristof traveled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to shine his light into the darkest pockets of conflict and poverty. On this trip, Kristof brought with him two young Americans, a student and a teacher. Their reflections of the heart-wrenching journey were posted alongside KristofÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bi-weekly columns.\n\nCongo is a country in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. To date, 5.4 million people have been killed in Congo over the last decade. The core reasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½instability. This is KristofÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chargeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to put Congo on the international agenda.\n\nBut Nick knows that statistics deaden his readers' interest and compassion. So to get the world to care, he goes in search of individuals whose stories will reflect the country's desperate crisis and mobilize readers worldwide. He journeys through ravaged villages and displacement camps, and makes a harrowing visit to Congo's reigning rebel warlord, General Nkunda, at his jungle hideout.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.reporterfilm.com/synopsis.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.reporterfilm.com/synopsis.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirected, Edited, and Photographed by Eric Daniel Metzgar\n\nProduced by Mikaela Beardsley and Steven Cantor\n\nExecutive Producer Ben Affleck","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:670251fcac6409700a708a2de3ade68400982dc5","amp;dn":"REPORTER.m4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"670251fcac6409700a708a2de3ade68400982dc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,2,81,252,172,100,9,112,10,112,138,45,227,173,230,132,0,152,45,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
