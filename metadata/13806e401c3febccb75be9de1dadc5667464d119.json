When the visitors arrived, the human population was\nenamored with, among other aspects, the aliens' advanced &quot;bio-suits&quot;, and\nsupposedly welcomed them with open arms. However, later, the aliens began\nmoving into other areas of the city, committing crimes in order to survive,\nand frequently clashing with the police. Playing as a documentary, the film\ncontinues, complete with interviews and footage taken from handheld cameras,\nhighlighting the growing tension between the civilian population and the visitors,\nespecially once the ships began to steal electricity and other resources from the\ncity.According to individuals &quot;interviewed&quot; in the film, the aliens were captive\nlabor (slaves or indentured servants), forced to live in &quot;conditions that were not\ngood&quot; and had escaped to Earth. Because the film takes place in 1990, while apartheid\nwas still in effect in South Africa, the aliens were forced to live amongst the\nalready-oppressed black population, causing conflict with them as well as the\nnon-white and white population.All of the interview statements which do not\nexplicitly mention extraterrestrials were taken from authentic interviews with\nSouth Africans who had been asked their opinions of Zimbabwean refugees\n\nProduction\n\nNeill Blomkamp...:Director / Producer\nSharlto Copley...:Producer\nSimon Hansen.....:Producer\nShannon Worley...:Producer\n\nCast\n\nDawie Ackermann..:Afrikaans Professor\nJason Cope.......:UN Official / Alien\nSharlto Copley...:Sniper\nBraam Greyling...:Cop 1\nGodfrey Seome....:Cop 2\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/15974854127042299956.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/15974854127042299956.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/95226963500518171795.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/95226963500518171795.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/62730776243501905303.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/62730776243501905303.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/64154529226444338379.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/64154529226444338379.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\ncover\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/99099653406641109203.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/99099653406641109203.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMovie Information\n\nTitle............: District 9\nRelease year.....: 2009\nLanguage.........: English\n\nRuntime..........: 1h 52mn\nGenre............: Science Fiction\nIMDb rating......: 8.3/10\nIMDB Link........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1136608/\n\nSource (DVD/DVDR 5,9).....: DVD 5\nTotal movie files size....: 3.03 GB\nBurn Tested...............: Yes\nPS3 Compatible............: Yes\n\nVideo / Audio Attribute's\n\nFormat....................: AVI\nVideo compression mode....: MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec ID..................: XVID\nAspect ratio..............: 1.860\n\nAudio coding mode.........: AC-3\nSampling rate.............: 48.0 KHz\nNumber of audio channels..: 6 channels Front: L C R, Side: L R,\n\nPlot summary\n\nDirector Neill Blomkamp teams with producer Peter Jackson for this tale of\nextraterrestrial refugees stuck in contemporary South Africa. It's been 28\nyears since the aliens made first contact, but there was never any attack from\nthe skies, nor any profound technological revelation capable of advancing our\nsociety. Instead, the aliens were treated as refugees. They were the last of\ntheir kind, and in order to accommodate them, the government of South Africa\nset up a makeshift home in District 9 as politicians and world leaders debated\nhow to handle the situation. As the humans begin to grow wary of the unwelcome\nintruders, a private company called Multi-National United (MNU) is assigned the\ntask of controlling the aliens. But MNU is less interested in the aliens'\nwelfare than attempting to understand how their weaponry works. Should they\nmanage to make that breakthrough, they will receive tremendous profits to fund\ntheir research. Unfortunately, the highly advanced weaponry requires alien DNA\nin order to be activated. When MNU field operative Wikus van der Merwe\n(Sharlto Copley) is exposed to biotechnology that causes his DNA to mutate,\nthe tensions between the aliens and the humans intensifies. Wikus is the key\nto unlocking the alien's technology, and he quickly becomes the most wanted man\non the planet. Ostracized and isolated, Wikus retreats to District 9 in a desperate\nbid to shake his dogged pursuers.\n\nProduction\n\nNeill Blomkamp........: Director / Screenwriter\nCarolynne Cunningham..: Producer\nPeter Jackson.........: Producer\nTerri Tatchell........: Screenwriter\nTrent Opaloch.........: Cinematographer\nMichelle Belcher......: Musical Direction/Supervision\nClinton Shorter.......: Composer (Music Score)\n\n\nCast\n\nSharlto Copley......: Wikus van der Merwe\nDavid James.........: Koobus Venter\nVanessa Haywood.....: Tania Van de Merwe\nMandla Gaduka.......: Fundiswa Mhlanga\nKenneth Nkosi.......: Thomas\nEugene Khumbanyiwa..: Obesandjo\nLouis Minnaar.......: Piet Smit\n\nscreens &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/86959546910583960543.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/86959546910583960543.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/77997489220582182065.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/77997489220582182065.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/14660179638724162624.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/14660179638724162624.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/36687377466052687452.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/36687377466052687452.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlive in Joburg is the short film that inspired the feature lenght film District 9","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13806e401c3febccb75be9de1dadc5667464d119","amp;dn":"Alive+in+Joburg+-+District+9+twin+pack+dvdrip+Xvid+Big+A+Little+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13806e401c3febccb75be9de1dadc5667464d119","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,128,110,64,28,63,235,204,183,91,233,222,29,173,197,102,116,100,209,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
