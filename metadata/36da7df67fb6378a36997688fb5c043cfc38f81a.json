AirRadar allows you to scan for open networks and tag them as favourites or filter them out. View detailed network information, graph network signal strength, and automatically join the best open network in range.\n\nWhether you are driving around looking for wireless networks, stuck in traffic, sitting on the beach, or if you are curious how strong your wireless signal is at home, AirRadar provides a more linear approach to network hunting. Setup a scan frequency, and have new open or closed networks have their name spoken, play alerts, or display notifications.\n\nVarious other options allow you to customize your network list further, including assigning colors to best open networks and sound cues. Download it today, and take the hardship out of getting an internet connection at a critical time.\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ NEW IN VERSION 2.0.2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n-New Feature: Can now drag text out of Details window and Main window into a text document.\n-New Feature: Icons in the view menu for major panes.\n-New Feature: Checkmarks in the view menu for major panes.\n-New Feature: Improved Preferences help tag for Rentention.\n-New Feature: Added more help to the unlicense window.\n-New Feature: Added menu item to start and stop the scan.\n-New Feature: Add to favs/filter is now smart and auto-fills based on the selection and asks how you'd like to remember the selected networks in the list.\n-New Feature: Start/Stop scan buttons have been added to the main toolbar.\n-New Feature: Improved text in filter/favourites window.\n-New Feature: Copy multiple network information rows out of the Network Details window.\n-New Feature: Added Columns menu to the View menu.\n-New Feature: Added command key to AirRadar option under the Window menu.\n-New Feature: Now greys out GROWL notifications if not installed.\n-New Feature: Improved error messages when scan results were incomplete from the system.\n-Bug Fix: Network graph now draws and updates while networks are selected and the app is receiving new network scan information.\n-Bug Fix: Will no longer crash if attempting to load an invalid/corrupt saved networks list.\n-Bug Fix: X in search window now disappears when no search is present.\n-Bug Fix: Fixed punctuation in dialog asking for network deletion.\n-Bug Fix: Trial will now be back to zero days if the users has never launched -AirRadar 2 before, but had been using AirRadar 1.\n-Bug Fix: Spelling of Favourites changed to Favorites for US language.\n-Bug Fix: Adjusting column widths when no list items are present now evenly spaces columns.\n-Bug Fix: Can no longer use contextual menus/copy/paste/etc. in the authentication dialog.\n\n\n\n*BIG THANKS TO TOBW!!!*\n\n\n\n\nMAC OS X ONLY!!!!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36da7df67fb6378a36997688fb5c043cfc38f81a","amp;dn":"AirRadar+2.0.2+%5BUB+k%5C%27d%5D.dmg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36da7df67fb6378a36997688fb5c043cfc38f81a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,218,125,246,127,182,55,138,54,153,118,136,251,92,4,60,252,56,248,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
