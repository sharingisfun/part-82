McKee's best batch of songs ever are complimented here by the twisted guitar of Jayhawk Gary Louris, which matches McKee, scream for scream, especially on the closing title track where Maria sends packing the guy she's been chasing all along. She's all over the place--&quot;I'm Gonna Soothe You&quot; is soul, &quot;Only Once&quot; honky-tonk, &quot;I Can't Make It Alone&quot; hard-edged pop--but it all works because McKee has finally reconciled her spirituality with her need for the sensual, over-the-top anthem. --David Cantwell\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:254828dea039dd86c2d6b561139e4ad885fa80d5","amp;dn":"Maria+McKee...You+Gotta+Sin+to+Get+Saved%281993%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"254828dea039dd86c2d6b561139e4ad885fa80d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,72,40,222,160,57,221,134,194,214,181,97,19,158,74,216,133,250,128,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
