That is, until her husband falls in love with her best friend. In order to get her money he pushes her off a boat and into the waiting jaws of a crocodile. However, she survives the attack and, although horribly disfigured, spends months under the operating table to have her face restored to a different beauty. Now, she returns to the city under a different name and with a different face to seek vengeance on her husband, who has told everyone she was taken by a crocodile, and is now waiting the 7-year legal waiting period until he can gain her money and marry her best friend. Now, she can have revenge...
