Their sound,\nhighly influenced by Gamma Ray (who has\ntraded members with this band) and Judas\nPriest, was introduced on their 1998\neponymous debut. The following year\nshowed them gathering a press following\nwhen Jaws of Death  gained them positive\nreviews from most respectable metal critics.\nOn top of that, their European popularity\nflourished as power metal enjoyed moderate\nsuccess in the overseas mainstream. Nuclear Fire\nfollowed in 2001, leading to their first\nU.S. appearances in the guise of several\nlarge metal festivals throughout the year.\nThey returned to the studio in early\n2002, recording and releasing Black Sun\nby the end of spring.\n\nTrack Listing\n\nChapter 1:\nViva la Swabia Tour Oct/Nov 2009 Europe / Switzerland.\n16.6 North America Tour Sep 2009 Atlanta / USA.\n\nTracklisting:\n01 Before The Devil Knows You're Dead\n02 Under The Radar\n03 Battalions Of Hate\n04 Killbound\n05 Nuclear Fire\n06 Six Times Dead (16.6)\n07 Angel In Black\n08 Guitars From Hell\n09 Sign Of Fear\n10 Fighting The Darkness:\na.
