An earlier CD was produced by the late pianist Michel Petrucciani, who\nobviously saw this newcomer as one filled with promise. Although Petrucciani\ndied just prior to the taping of these sessions, he is obviously present in the\nspirit of Avitabile's playing. Joined by veteran first-call bassist Niels\nPedersen and drummer Roberto Gatto, the pianist starts off with an attractive\noriginal jazz waltz, &quot;Miss Laurence.&quot; He follows it up with a well disguised and\nsomewhat dark introduction to Dave Brubeck's normally joyful &quot;In Your Own Sweet\nWay&quot;; his journey through this often recorded jazz standard is also atypical. He\nalso avoids predictability with his intriguing chart of Dizzy Gillespie's &quot;Con\nAlma&quot; and the venerable standard &quot;Cherokee.&quot; His &quot;Right Time!&quot; is a smoking bop\nnumber that features Pedersen's tremendous solo chops, while &quot;Song for Evan&quot; is\na touching ballad that has an almost reverent quality. Louis Petrucciani,\nMichel's brother, takes over for Pedersen on his own soulful &quot;Blues for the\nStars&quot; and the leader's samba-flavored &quot;Facin' Up.&quot; Highly recommended.\n\n* Franck Avitabile: piano\n* Niels-Henning ÃƒÆ’Ã‹Å“rsted-Pedersen Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«NHÃƒÆ’Ã‹Å“PÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â»: bass\n* Roberto Gatto: drums\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e94d91561d14f2c0ba2bd78c23c0f3a6e2fcf8d2","amp;dn":"Franck+Avitabile+-+Right+Time+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e94d91561d14f2c0ba2bd78c23c0f3a6e2fcf8d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,77,145,86,29,20,242,192,186,43,215,140,35,192,243,166,226,252,248,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
