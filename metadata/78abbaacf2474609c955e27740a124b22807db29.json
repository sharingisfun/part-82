All you recognize is when\nit came back to the source and become aware of the discourse again.\n\nWith Fluctuation meditation, the background music is specifically\nselected to be beautiful and conductive to meditative state.\nYou will be taken through different spaces, world traditions,\nand musical styles from ancient to modern. The best of the best.\n\nThe chance of you staying with the discourse is much higher.\nIf your mind wonders away from the discourse,\nif becomes occupied with the beauty of music,\nand so it becomes much easier to become aware\nof how your mind wonders away from the present moment.\n\nJust lay back, close your eyes and enjoy this space of silence.\nThere is nothing to do.\nEverything is in a perfect shape, as perfect as it gets.\n\nFinally, you can search on anything you want out of Osho books\non line from:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://oshosearch.net/Convert/search.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://oshosearch.net/Convert/search.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nor view the entire collection at:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://oshosearch.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://oshosearch.net&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78abbaacf2474609c955e27740a124b22807db29","amp;dn":"Osho+-+Fluctuation+Meditation+-+Bodhidharma+-+The+Greatest+Zen+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78abbaacf2474609c955e27740a124b22807db29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,171,186,172,242,71,70,9,201,85,226,119,64,161,36,178,40,7,219,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
