Well for Nisha (Tamannaah Bhatia), what starts as a hatred turns into love with Krishna. But sooner as she finds her beau so irresponsible swapping jobs often, she breaks up with him. Sooner the story shifts to Malaysia, where NishaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s parents arrange her marriage with Krishna Kumar (Shaam), a tough and honest cop. Krishna Kumar uncovers that he has traveled all the way to Malaysia to trap a smart thief, who has been looting crores of money from leading tycoons and politicians. The intriguing part of the film is about the fact that the thief is none other than NishaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ex-boyfriend Krishna.\nRest of the film is all about how Krishna wins back the heart of Nisha and the reason behind his robberies having a substantial reason.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20f3589ef4460e00656043cd76438e5073a61e1a","amp;dn":"Thillanlangadi+DVD+1+CDRip+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20f3589ef4460e00656043cd76438e5073a61e1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,243,88,158,244,70,14,0,101,96,67,205,118,67,142,80,115,166,30,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
