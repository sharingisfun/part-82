Starring Jared Padalecki as Sam Winchester and Jensen Ackles as Dean Winchester, the series follows the brothers as they hunt demons and other figures of the paranormal. The series is produced by Warner Bros. Television, in association with Wonderland Sound and Vision. The current executive producers are Eric Kripke, McG, and Robert Singer; former executive producer Kim Manners died of lung cancer during production of the fourth season.\nThe series, which is filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, was in development for nearly ten years, as creator Kripke spent several years unsuccessfully pitching it as a series. The pilot was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, and the ratings of the first four episodes prompted The WB to pick up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. Originally, Kripke planned the series for three seasons, but later expanded it to five. The fifth season began airing on September 10, 2009, and concluded the series' main storyline; however, The CW officially renewed the show for a sixth season on February 16, 2010. Kripke has confirmed that he will not be returning as showrunner; however, he will still remain as an executive producer. Sera Gamble, replacing Kripke as showrunner, has stated that the sixth season will focus on the brothers' relationship.\n\n.: Screenshot :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/2fdcd999229365&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/2fdcd999229365&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/f0befa99229391&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/f0befa99229391&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/59e64499229424&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/59e64499229424&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/4e381999229448&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/4e381999229448&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/bdde1199229431&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/bdde1199229431&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/f10cdf99229452&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/f10cdf99229452&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/860b3499229483&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/860b3499229483&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/e40cf099229486&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/e40cf099229486&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b337a40d314e9b13c2feb8ea4f523a4a1b932cb6","amp;dn":"Supernatural.S06E02.HDTV.XviD-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b337a40d314e9b13c2feb8ea4f523a4a1b932cb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,55,164,13,49,78,155,19,194,254,184,234,79,82,58,74,27,147,44,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
