When contact is suddenly lost with the colonists, Ripley returns to the planet with a squad of marines, an android (Lance Henriksen), and a Company executive (Paul Reiser) with a mission of his own. Once on the planet, no survivors can be found except for Newt, a little girl who awakens motherly instincts in Ripley just in time for the acid-blooded aliens to attack in what quickly becomes a one-sided battle for sheer survival.\nGenre: Action | Horror | Sci-Fi | Thriller\nLanguage: English\n\nVideo Specifications:\n\nFilm Length: 2:34:27\nFormat: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\nBitrate: 1496 kbps\nFramerate: 23.976 FPS\nEncoder: x264\nResolution: 720 x 384\nAspect Ratio: 1.875\nAdvanced Encoding: 2-Pass Encoding\nQuality Factor QF: 0.226\nSize of MP4 file: 1.75 GB (1,794 MB / 1,837,584 KB / 1,881,686,699 bytes)\nOriginal Source: 720p - WiKi\n\n===\n\n\nMovie Information:\n\nMovie Title: Alien 3 1992 Special Edition\nBluray Release Date: Oct 26, 2010\nCertification: Rated R\nStoryline: A penal colony and its inhabitants, a religious brotherhood of ex-convicts, is infiltrated by an alien when a ship carrying Ripley crash lands there.\nGenre: Action | Horror | Sci-Fi | Thriller\nLanguage: English\n\nVideo Specifications:\n\nFilm Length:\nFormat: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\nBitrate: 1603 kbps\nFramerate: 23.976 FPS\nEncoder: x264\nResolution: 720 x 304\nAspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nAdvanced Encoding: 2-Pass Encoding\nQuality Factor QF: 0.305\nSize of MP4 file: 1.75 GB (1,794 MB / 1,837,229 KB / 1,881,322,644 bytes)\nOriginal Source: 720p - WiKi\n\n===\n\n\nMovie Information:\n\nMovie Title: Alien Resurrection 1997 Special Edition\nBluray Release Date: Oct 26, 2010\nCertification: Rated R\nStoryline: Ripley is brought back to life, from cloned DNA, by evil scientists who want to resurrect the alien that died inside her.\nGenre: Action | Horror | Sci-Fi | Thriller\nLanguage: English\n\nVideo Specifications:\n\nFilm Length: 1:56:09\nFormat: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\nBitrate: 1725 kbps\nFramerate: 23.976 FPS\nEncoder: x264\nResolution: 720 x 304\nAspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nAdvanced Encoding: 2-Pass Encoding\nQuality Factor QF: 0.329\nSize of MP4 file: 1.50 GB (1,539 MB / 1,576,415 KB / 1,614,249,243 bytes)\nOriginal Source: 720p - WiKi\n\n===\n\n\nAudio Specifications:\n\nFormat: AAC-LC\nBitrate: AAC = 128 kbps / AAC 5.1 = 300 kbps\nChannels: AAC-LC= 2 / AAC 5.1 = 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48000Hz\nSubtitles: English.srt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c88f599611166b1d86f350665fd15f5d7af441d4","amp;dn":"Alien+Anthology+BRRip+%7BMnM-RG+H264%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c88f599611166b1d86f350665fd15f5d7af441d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,143,89,150,17,22,107,29,134,243,80,102,95,209,95,93,122,244,65,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
