Director, James Fox assembled the most credible UFO witnesses from around the world to testify at The National Press Club in Washington D.C.: Air Force Generals, astronauts, military and commercial pilots, government and FAA officials from seven countries tell stories that, as Governor Fife Symington from Arizona stated, &quot;will challenge your reality&quot;.\n\nTheir accounts reveal a behind-the-scenes U.S. operation whose policy is to confiscate and hoard substantiating evidence from close encounters to the extent that even Presidents have failed to get straight answers. I KNOW WHAT I SAW exposes reasons behind government secrecy from those involved at the highest level.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.disclose.tv/action/viewvideo/31098/I_Know_What_I_Saw/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.disclose.tv/action/viewvideo/31098/I_Know_What_I_Saw/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n+\n\nAVI Information\n   Filename: Larry King Live - November 9th 2007.avi\n   Filesize: 143982244 Bytes (137.31 MB)\n   Streams (i.e. Video, Audio): 2\nVideo Stream\n   Compression: MP43 - Unknown\n   Avg.

So too have former governors, high level military and government officials, highly\ntrained airplane pilots and aviation experts. The phenomenon is real. It happens worldwide. No one is sure about\nits nature. Experts from seven countries will divulge what they have discovered about UFOs at a November 12\npanel discussion moderated by former Arizona Governor Fife Symington (R) at the National Press Club.\nJust one year ago, pilots, mechanics and managers from United Airlines witnessed a metallic disc-shaped object\nhovering over the United Airlines Terminal at ChicagoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Hare Airport. The clearly observed object shot\nstraight up leaving a hole through the clouds. Despite the clear aviation safety issues involved, the Federal\nAviation Administration (FAA) never investigated the incident and dismissed it as weather. This head-in-theclouds\nrefusal to investigate stands in sharp contrast to efforts by governments of other countries to understand\nthese incidents.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI believe that our government should take an active role in investigating this very real phenomenon,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ said\nSymington, who was a witness to the famed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Phoenix LightsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ incident seen by hundreds in Arizona while he was\ngovernor. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis panel consists of some of the most qualified people in the world with direct experience in dealing\nwith this issue, and they will bring incredible, irrefutable evidence, some never presented before, that we simply\ncannot dismiss or ignore,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he said.\n\nThe group, using previously classified documents, will discuss many well-documented cases, including two\ninvestigated by the US government. The first involves a Peruvian Air Force pilot who fired many rounds at a\nUFO which was not affected. The second was an Iranian Air Force pilotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attempt to fire at a UFO, but whose\ncontrol panel became inoperable. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis case is a classic that meets all the necessary conditions for a legitimate\nstudy of the UFO phenomenon,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ stated the US Defense Intelligence Agency document on the Tehran incident.\nBoth pilots will come forward to speak about these events publicly for the first time.\n\n\nWHO:\n\n\n- Fife Symington, Former Arizona Governor, Moderator\n- Ray Bowyer, Captain, Aurigny Air Services, Channel Islands\n- Rodrigo Bravo, Captain and Pilot for the Aviation Army of Chile\n- General Wilfried De Brouwer, former Deputy Chief of Staff, Belgian Air Force (Ret.)\n- John Callahan, Chief of Accidents and Investigations for the FAA, 1980ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s (Ret.)\n- Dr. Anthony Choy, founder, 2001, OIFAA, Peruvian Air Force\n- Jean-Claude Duboc, Captain, Air France (Ret.)\n- Charles I.
