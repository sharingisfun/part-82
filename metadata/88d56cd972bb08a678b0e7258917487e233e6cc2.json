If they legalized it, they may be correct. Smoking Pot is a sin? NOT. Drinking Wine a Sin? Nope. It's in The Bible, The Divine Word of God!!!  I actually registered to vote for the first time in 30 years. I voted &quot;ONCE&quot; in the seventies. Only took ONE time to figure out that the system is rigged and does NOT work for the People that voted them in and sign their paychecks. Votem &quot;ALL&quot; out. New blood please!!!\n\nGENESIS 1:29\n29  And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.\n\nDid you know that there are 23 different trees listed in the Bible? Did you know that when this text is written in Hebrew, all 23 trees are spelled with ELS in that 1 sentence. Google: equal distance letter sequence. For a better explanation than I care give. (Eg. Write down every 7th letter to make a word.)This happens only in The original Hebrew Torah.- Old Testament.   If just one letter in The Scriptures was changed this phenomena would not happen. There are thousands of Hidden Codes in The Bible. Google: Bible Codes, for more info.\n\n\n\ntype POtHS in your search window for more info.\n\n\nRAPtURE  (My transportation outta here.)\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOtHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH that Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever with him...Praise Jesus, Amen.\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the tRUtH.    \n\nGet info on the Take Over by The New World Order Below\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&lt;/a&gt;\nListen to Alex Jones &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bibledatabase.com/html_bibles.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bibledatabase.com/html_bibles.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://hickoryhammockbaptist.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://hickoryhammockbaptist.org&lt;/a&gt;\n \nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father.
