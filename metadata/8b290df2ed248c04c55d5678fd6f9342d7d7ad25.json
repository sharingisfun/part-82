Opening with the storming title track, The Queen Is Dead is a harder-rocking record than anything the Smiths had attempted before, but that's only on a relative scale -- although the backbeat is more pronounced, the group certainly doesn't rock in a conventional sense. Instead, Johnny Marr has created a dense web of guitars, alternating from the minor-key rush of &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot; and the faux rockabilly of &quot;Vicar in a Tutu&quot; to the bouncy acoustic pop of &quot;Cemetry Gates&quot; and &quot;The Boy With the Thorn in His Side,&quot; as well as the lovely melancholy of &quot;I Know It's Over&quot; and &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out.&quot; And the rich musical bed provides Morrissey with the support for his finest set of lyrics. Shattering the myth that he is a self-pitying sap, Morrissey delivers a devastating set of clever, witty satires of British social mores, intellectualism, class, and even himself. He also crafts some of his finest, most affecting songs, particularly in the wistful &quot;The Boy With the Thorn in His Side&quot; and the epic &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out,&quot; two masterpieces that provide the foundation for a remarkable album.\n\n\nSource: CD\nReleaded: 1986\nLabel: \nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Alternative\nQuality: FLAC\n\nTracks:\n\n  1.
