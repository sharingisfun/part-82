Audio was nice and seemed to be in sync.\nWork done.....well firstly we took the english.srt file and remove 100's of lines that wasn't needed and left those that was and resaved it.\nThen we made a small script to crop, resize, white balance, rgb eq, sharpness, brightness, contrast and a smoother and drop it into vdub.\nNow we've noticed through out the film the colouring changes ... sometimes gets a tint of green come and go ... nothing major though.\nThe audio we just remuxed the original AC3 audio track back to it.\n\nYes we know there are loads of encodes already and we wasn't going to do this but were asked by several users and once we got the dvd6, we thought sod it and did one :P\n\ncredit IMAGiNE &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, extremezone, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic, FASAMOO, W1CK3D1NT3Z, GRIND3R, extremezone, MonsterTV &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/karate%20kid%20r6%20non%20subbed/vlcsnap-86632.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/karate%20kid%20r6%20non%20subbed/vlcsnap-86632.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/karate%20kid%20r6%20non%20subbed/vlcsnap-88062.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/karate%20kid%20r6%20non%20subbed/vlcsnap-88062.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/karate%20kid%20r6%20non%20subbed/vlcsnap-89903.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/karate%20kid%20r6%20non%20subbed/vlcsnap-89903.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/karate%20kid%20r6%20non%20subbed/vlcsnap-90823.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/karate%20kid%20r6%20non%20subbed/vlcsnap-90823.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/karate%20kid%20r6%20non%20subbed/vlcsnap-95939.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/karate%20kid%20r6%20non%20subbed/vlcsnap-95939.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDON'T THANK ME...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:816e7c79585399076f0108492773b8f0d0c24f7a","amp;dn":"Karate+Kid+2010+R6+READNFO+XViD+-+IMAGiNE%28HARD+ENG+SUBS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"816e7c79585399076f0108492773b8f0d0c24f7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,110,124,121,88,83,153,7,111,1,8,73,39,115,184,240,208,194,79,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
