I know a lot of people have been looking for the software straight up (not the updates) which Canon seems to be real dickish about handing it out so I\\'ve decided to do it myself. Once you install the programs on the CD you can go to the Canon website for updates. Hope this helps!\n\nContents:\n\nMac: \n\nImageBrowser 5.8\nPhotoStitch 3.1\nEOS Utility 1.1\n\nWindows:\n\nZoomBrowser EX 5.8\nPhotoStitch 3.1\nCamera TWAIN Driver 6.7\nEOS Utility 1.1\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:607facfa03ed4f93bdaf7a3b80472fca0ff3e233","amp;dn":"Canon+Digital+Camera+Solutions+Disk+ver.30.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"607facfa03ed4f93bdaf7a3b80472fca0ff3e233","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,127,172,250,3,237,79,147,189,175,122,59,128,71,47,202,15,243,226,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
