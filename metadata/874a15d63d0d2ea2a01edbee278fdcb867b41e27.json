Here he carries readers back to the 1876 battle in Montana \nmythologized as &quot;CusterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Last Stand.&quot; Focusing on the charismatic Sitting Bull \nand the recklessly brave George Armstrong Custer, Philbrick constructs a \nriveting narrative of the battle that became the archetypal story of the West.\n\n\nFrom NathanielPhilbrick.com:\n\nLittle Bighorn and Custer are names synonymous in the American imagination with \nunmatched bravery and spectacular defeat. Mythologized as CusterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Last Stand, \nthe June 1876 battle has been equated with other famous last stands, from the \nSpartansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ defeat at Thermopylae to Davy Crockett at the Alamo.\n\nIn his tightly structured narrative, Nathaniel Philbrick brilliantly sketches \nthe two larger-than-life antagonists: Sitting Bull, whose charisma and political \nsavvy earned him the position of leader of the Plains Indians, and George \nArmstrong Custer, one of the UnionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest cavalry officers and a man with a \nreputation for fearless and often reckless courage. Philbrick reminds readers \nthat the Battle of the Little Bighorn was also, even in victory, the last stand \nfor the Sioux and Cheyenne Indian nations. Increasingly outraged by the \ngovernmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Indian policies, the Plains tribes allied themselves and held their \nground in southern Montana. Within a few years of Little Bighorn, however, all \nthe major tribal leaders would be confined to Indian reservations.\n\nThroughout, Philbrick beautifully evokes the history and geography of the Great \nPlains with his characteristic grace and sense of drama. The Last Stand is a \nmesmerizing account of the archetypal story of the American West, one that \ncontinues to haunt our collective imagination.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:874a15d63d0d2ea2a01edbee278fdcb867b41e27","amp;dn":"THE+LAST+STAND+-+Nathaniel+Philbrick.+George+Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"874a15d63d0d2ea2a01edbee278fdcb867b41e27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,74,21,214,61,13,46,162,160,30,219,238,39,143,220,184,103,180,30,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
