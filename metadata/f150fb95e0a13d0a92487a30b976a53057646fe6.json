Recorded over a span of about two years at the Red Room Studio in their home town of Staten Island, NY.\n\nCombining Folk, Rock, Indie and a mix of other genres, the album sometimes sways towards an acoustic singer songwriter style and at others goes straight rock and roll! It is filled with coming of age tales like &quot;Captain Hook&quot;, and blue collar anthems such as &quot;Garbage Man&quot; which has been featured on NYC Rock Station 101.9 WRXP\n\n\nWhat people have been saying:\n&quot;the title track itself is a prime example of this bandÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s ability to seamlessly adhere musical convergence with a continual flow of familiarity.

Like of all the stuff that started in Staten Island.... This is my favorite band out of Staten Island... &quot; - Rich Russo, WRXP\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f150fb95e0a13d0a92487a30b976a53057646fe6","amp;dn":"The+Seconds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f150fb95e0a13d0a92487a30b976a53057646fe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,80,251,149,224,161,61,10,146,72,122,48,185,118,165,48,87,100,111,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
