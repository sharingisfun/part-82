But beyond the fringes of explored space lurk the Reapers, a race of sentient starships bent on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œharvestingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the galaxyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s organic species for their own dark purpose.\n\nThe Illusive Man, leader of the pro-human black ops group Cerberus, is one of the few who know the truth about the Reapers. To ensure humanityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s survival, he launches a desperate plan to uncover the enemyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s strengthsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and weaknessesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½by studying someone implanted with modified Reaper technology. He knows the perfect subject for his horrific experiments: former Cerberus operative Paul Grayson, who wrested his daughter from the cabalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s control with the help of Ascension project director Kahlee Sanders.\n\nBut when Kahlee learns that Grayson is missing, she turns to the only person she can trust: Alliance war hero Captain David Anderson. Together they set out to find the secret Cerberus facility where Grayson is being held. But they arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the only ones after him. And time is running out.\n\nAs the experiments continue, the sinister Reaper technology twists GraysonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mind. The insidious whispers grow ever stronger in his head, threatening to take over his very identity and unleash the Reapers on an unsuspecting galaxy.\n\nThis novel is based on a Mature-rated video game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:582367b2f70597b61a5b2556b2f50d3b60d16eb2","amp;dn":"Mass+Effect+-+Retribution+by+Drew+Karpyshyn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"582367b2f70597b61a5b2556b2f50d3b60d16eb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,35,103,178,247,5,151,182,26,91,37,86,178,245,13,59,96,209,110,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
