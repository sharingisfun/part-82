As with its predecessor, the album is an exemplary look at Wainwright's career up to the point of the album's release. CAREER MOVES is a generous helping of 19 songs, and includes six new ones. The album was recorded on a single night at one of his regular and favored venues, New York City's Bottom Line, and benefits from the contributions of multi-instrumentalists Chaim Tannenbaum and David Mansfield.\n\nThroughout, Wainwright's casual ease shines through as he toys with his own songs and jokes with the audience. With a wealth of material to draw from, he offers old favorites such as &quot;The Swimming Song&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Couldn't Cry&quot; (which Johnny Cash covered, closing his AMERICAN RECORDINGS the following year), and obscurities like &quot;The Acid Song.&quot; He especially shines on delicately emotional autobiographical numbers like &quot;Westchester County,&quot; &quot;Five Years Old,&quot; &quot;April Fool's Day Morn.&quot; CAREER MOVES is an excellent introduction to Wainwright's work, as well as an engaging set for those already familiar\n\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:117656e9dc8b3ec17ee231ce6ebf434555238ce3","amp;dn":"Loudon+Wainwright+III...Career+Moves%281992%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"117656e9dc8b3ec17ee231ce6ebf434555238ce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,118,86,233,220,139,62,193,126,226,49,206,110,191,67,69,85,35,140,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
