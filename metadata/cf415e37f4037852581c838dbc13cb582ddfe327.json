Released on July 22, 2010. \n\nI have ripped the video files and encoded to 2 DVD-5 disc images. The play itself is over 3.5 hours long in two acts. Act I is on the first disc and Act II on the second. I've added a simple title menu as well. The DVDs were mastered from the 480p video files ripped using a firefox extension. I had trouble getting the audio to stay in sync with the HD videos for some reason. I have tested playback of the image in VLC, and burned discs in both my cheap Insignia DVD player and a PS2. Burn at a low speed to avoid errors. \n\nAnyway, I created the A Very Potter Musical DVD also available here on Pirate Bay, and thought I'd do the same for the sequel. It's really funny and has more great music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf415e37f4037852581c838dbc13cb582ddfe327","amp;dn":"A+Very+Potter+Sequel+-+DVDx2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf415e37f4037852581c838dbc13cb582ddfe327","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,65,94,55,244,3,120,82,88,28,131,141,188,19,203,88,45,223,227,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
