This is their first studio album, and first time with Todd Pot.  They went on the record a plethora of other albums with Todd, but in my opinion, this is still the best!\n     Only saw one other A.H. torrent on any site, but I couldn't get any seeders!  I also intend to up the rest of their discography.
