The series resembles Dancing with the Stars, but in this case the women are famous figure skaters and the men are well-known hockey players.\n\nIf you are a fan of figure skating, ice hockey or Dancing With The Stars, this show is worth a try.\n\nIn Season 2, the figure skaters are Shae-Lynn Bourne, Kyoko Ina, Violetta Afanasieva, Christine Hough-Sweeney, Anabelle Langlois, Isabelle Brasseur, Ekaterina Gordeeva and Jamie SalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©.\n\nThe hockey players this season are Patrice Brisebois, Kelly Chase, P.J. Stock, Russ Courtnall, Georges Laraque, Todd Warriner, Valeri Bure and Theo Fleury.\n\nThe hosts are Kurt Browning and Ron Maclean.\n\n\nIn this episode, we get some background on each of the 16 competitors and see them going through figure skating boot camp.\n\nThe resolution is 624x352 and the video is 44:26 long. The video quality isn't perfect, but it is quite watchable in my opinion. This episode aired on CBC on Sep 26, 2010. \n\nCBC has a big website for this show at http://www.cbc.ca/battle/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d617939fd547d7d6a37f2d06d0fe79b9a8fabbe6","amp;dn":"Battle.of.the.Blades.S02E00.Game.On.WS.XviD-err0001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d617939fd547d7d6a37f2d06d0fe79b9a8fabbe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,23,147,159,213,71,215,214,163,127,45,6,208,254,121,185,168,250,187,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
