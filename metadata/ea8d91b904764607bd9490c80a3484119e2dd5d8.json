(^_^)\n\nTaglines: Learn to speak her language. \n\nGenres: Drama | Romance\n\nMovie Nfo - An eager young Englishman is dispatched to Sarawak to become part of the British colonial government, encounters some unorthodox local traditions, and finds himself faced with tough decisions of the heart involving the beautiful young Selima, the unwitting object of his affections.  \n\nReview from IMDB - I watched this film after reading the reviews made by others here and i have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it even if I am, outwardly, the perfect example of emotionally repressed male.\n\nFirstly, it isn't going to win Oscars for anything really but that really isn't the point at all and nor should it be. It's a gentle, almost passive, love story that focuses in on the characters but uses their respective backgrounds and the limitations of their society's expectations as a character in its own right. All set in a time and place sufficiently remote to suspend disbelief, but close enough, to enable the viewer to relate.\n\nIt's well written, directed, filmed and acted with the actors delivering more than adequate performances that are sufficient to actually care what happens to them.\n\nFor the repressed male, like me, who is considering watching this film out of duty to his girlfriend, don't be disheartened you will most likely enjoy it if you allow yourself to. If nothing else the lovely Jessica Alba continues to enchant the male audience with nothing but her screen presence and in some scenes her lack of clothes.\n\nFor the female and non-repressed males, I recommend this film to you, not as classic but a sweet, enchanting and humorous love story. You will no doubt only watch the film once but then repeated viewings will add little.\n\nIt is what it is and nothing more but for a film of this type that's all it should be and that's all it tries to be.\n\nFor this reason and this reason only I gave this film 9/10 for they achieved what they set out to achieve. \n\n\nVideo Specs: \nVideo #0          : AVC at 400 Kbps\nAspect            : 464 x 256 (1.813) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz \n\nPlease seed when finished downloading and leave a comment, request, etc. And above all ENJOY! \n\nIf you would like to live chat or instant message me, here is one of my many contacts -  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;07666960626b6e6463626a6869313e476f68736a666e6b29646829726c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;  \n\nIf anyone would like any tv show, movie, music video, or yes, even XXX, for PSP or any other handheld device for that matter.
