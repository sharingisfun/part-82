The Windermere Two Way Swim is organised by the British Long Distance Swimming Association and is one of the most extreme endurance challenges in England. Held at Windermere every other year, people come from all over Britain to compete. Former president of the Association Janet Wilson says: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe slower swimmers could take 16, 17, 18 hours.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17a62b967adeb016c43218d087373ced4b548a05","amp;dn":"The.Lakes.2010.S01E02.WS.PDTV.XviD.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17a62b967adeb016c43218d087373ced4b548a05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,166,43,150,122,222,176,22,196,50,24,208,135,55,60,237,75,84,138,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
