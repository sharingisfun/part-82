Moving from one city neighborhood to the next may be like passing from one country to another. New York is the most populous and the most international city in the country. Its urban area extends into adjoining parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Located where the Hudson and East rivers empty into one of the world's premier harbors, New York is both the gateway to the North American continent and its preferred exit to the oceans of the globe.\n\nFile Size ------- 697mb\nLength ---------- 1:30:29\nResolution ------ 720x432\nContainer ------- avi\nVideo Codec ----- h264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 24\n\nTracked and seeded by thehashden.com\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c4a86c3c28afe1c7dca4df8d8a26ec0f1f67c7a","amp;dn":"History+Channel%3A+Super+City+-+New+York","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c4a86c3c28afe1c7dca4df8d8a26ec0f1f67c7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,74,134,195,194,138,254,28,125,202,77,248,216,162,110,192,241,246,124,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
