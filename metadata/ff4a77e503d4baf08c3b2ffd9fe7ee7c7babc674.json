This means Reshade reduces or eliminates most of the usual side-effects of photo enlargement:\n# pixelation: visible square pixels in an image\n# loss of focus: blurry / out of focus image edges\n# loss of sharpness: reduced edge contrast\n# exagerated noise: random pixel values, stains\n\nUsually in image interpolation there is a tradeoff between sharpness and blur. If you want to remove blur and maintain sharpness you get pixelated and noisy images and vice-versa. Reshade balances as best as possible the 4 factors offering quality photo enlargement that maintains all the details in the original image at the same time.\n\n***** Advantages of using Reshade over other image resizers:\n# works at all zoom levels: other professional resizers have only specific ranges (1-4x, 3x-5x etc) where they work right\n# highest accuracy: even the finest textures in the original image are preserved (best forensic photo enlarger)\n# doesn't lose photo realism: other resizers smooth the image too much in the interpolation process\n\n==============================================================\n***** CREDITS *****\n\nTeam RESURRECTiON : v1.51\nLz0 : v2.0b\n^ info@ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warez_scene\n\noo wait, 'Portable': the gr8 me :)\n\n==============================================================\nOther torrent uploads @ http://thepiratebay.se/user/mad_d0g_bay\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff4a77e503d4baf08c3b2ffd9fe7ee7c7babc674","amp;dn":"ReShade+Image+Resizer+-+v1.51+%2B+v2.0b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff4a77e503d4baf08c3b2ffd9fe7ee7c7babc674","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,74,119,229,3,212,186,240,140,59,47,253,159,231,238,124,123,171,198,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
