Some officers who heard it say they refused to carry it out. Others say they understood it as a fundamental change in the standards on deadly force, which allow police to fire only to protect themselves or others from what appears to be an imminent physical threat.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 56mn 39s 899ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 995 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 138 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee9f3d750043cc768c02c98df0cdb686d10832b0","amp;dn":"Frontline.S28E21.Law.%26.Disorder.PDTV.XviD-Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee9f3d750043cc768c02c98df0cdb686d10832b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,159,61,117,0,67,204,118,140,2,201,141,240,205,182,134,209,8,50,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
