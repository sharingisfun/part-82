There are 17 songs in total. Included is a tribute song to one of RF's favorite bands, Dead Moon, and a cover of Husker Du's &quot;Pink turns to Blue&quot;. The CD is called &quot;Obliteration By Time (New Recordings of Old Favorites)&quot; Think it's a great way to check out RF's old records. The record was recorded at Blue Room Studios with Mike Coykendall at the helm.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b1cab62eac0a127e55a5064bec22dbfcc34fcd8","amp;dn":"Richmond+Fontaine...Obliteration+by+Time%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b1cab62eac0a127e55a5064bec22dbfcc34fcd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,28,171,98,234,192,161,39,229,90,80,100,190,194,45,191,204,52,252,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
