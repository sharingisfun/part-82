[promo].VOB\n\n\n\nHQ rare promo music video. It Ain't What You Do (It's the Way That You Do It)&quot; is a song written by jazz musicians Melvin &quot;Sy&quot; Oliver and James &quot;Trummy&quot; Young. It was first recorded in 1939 by both Jimmie Lunceford and Ella Fitzgerald. Terry Hall of Fun Boy Three owned a copy of Bananarama's previous single &quot;Aie a Mwana&quot; and after seeing an article about the trio in The Face he decided he wanted them to sing background vocals on this song, solely based on the fact that he liked their look. &quot;It Ain't What You Do....&quot; became a big hit in the UK, climbing to number four in the UK singles chart. The success of this single also prompted Bananarama to return the favor and have Fun Boy Three sing on their next single &quot;Really Saying Something&quot;. \n(video has a 5 semi-transparent blue dots at the bottom right)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%27ain%27t_What_You_Do_(It%27s_the_Way_That_You_Do_It)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%27ain%27t_What_You_Do_(It%27s_the_Way_That_You_Do_It)&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6000kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Media Length: 00:02:46\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
