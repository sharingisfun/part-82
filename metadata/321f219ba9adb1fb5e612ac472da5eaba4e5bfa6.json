The programme also features previously unreported material of insurgents being killed while trying to surrender.\n\nChannel 4 is the only UK broadcaster to have been given access to nearly 400,000 secret military significant activities reports (SIGACTS) logged by the US military in Iraq between 2004 and 2009. These reports tell the story of the war and occupation which the US military did not want the world to know.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:321f219ba9adb1fb5e612ac472da5eaba4e5bfa6","amp;dn":"+C4+Dispatches+-+Iraqs+Secret+War+Files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"321f219ba9adb1fb5e612ac472da5eaba4e5bfa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,31,33,155,169,173,177,251,94,97,42,196,114,218,94,171,164,229,191,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
