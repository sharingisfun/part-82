The player will be armed with various authentic modern military small arms and placed in combat designed to simulate modern warfare.\n The gameplay is designed to be realistic, and to this end EA has hired several consultants from the United States military. Typical in-game objectives are expected to be similar to those issued in real life such as raiding terrorist hideouts, hostage rescues and undercover operations. The single player is set to include drivable vehicles such as helicopters, jeeps, bikes, and ATV\\'s.\n The gameplay uses recharging health, rather than fixed health points. If the player is wounded, the screen turns red, and the player must avoid taking damage for several seconds to return to full health.\n The game features iron sights as well as red dot sights and other aiming accessories. The player will shoot much more accurately while using the weapon\\'s sights than when firing from the hip. *\n\n\nMinimum  PC Configurations\n--------------------------------------------\nMedal of Honor requires at the following minimum configuration:\nOperating System\tWindows XP (SP3), Windows Vista (SP2), Windows 7\nProcessor\t\tPentium D, 3.2GHz / Core 2 Duo, 2.0GHz / Athlon 64 X2\nMemory\t\t\t2GB RAM\nVideo Card \t\tVideo card must be 256MB or more and contain these chipsets or better: NVIDIA GeForce 7800 GT ; ATI X1900.
