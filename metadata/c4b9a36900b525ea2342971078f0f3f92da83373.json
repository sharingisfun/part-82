It had a well-chosen selection of tracks, there was nothing to complain about it and a new album was about to be released, too. The situation is similar in 2003. Eighteen months ago Peter promised that a new album would be released. It was to be called IO and was allegedly almost completed. What followed was an extensive tour, numerous interview in which he mentioned even more different album titles and ideas for new project, the Growing Up Live DVD, even his collaboration on a fantasy game for PC, an almost finished songwritersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ version of OVO and the announcement of a new soundtrack project. Now there is HIT. Peter Gabriel is and will remain the master of getting distracted.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img80.imageshack.us/img80/1986/gabrielpeterhit4dl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img80.imageshack.us/img80/1986/gabrielpeterhit4dl.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\nCd 1:\n\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Solsbury Hill (4:23)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Shock The Monkey (3:59)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Sledgehammer (4:52)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Give Up (5:56)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Games Without Frontiers (3:58)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Big Time (4:28)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Burn You Up, Burn You Down (5:26)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Growing Up (4:49)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Digging In The Dirt (5:15)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Blood Of Eden (5:07)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· More Than This (4:34)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Biko (6:59)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Steam (6:03)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Red Rain (5:39)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Here Comes The Flood (4:33)\n\nCD 2:\n\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· San Jacinto (6:31)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· No Self-Control (3:55)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Cloudless (4:48)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The Rhythm Of The Heat (5:19)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· I Have The Touch (4:19)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· I Grieve (7:25)\n      Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· D.I.Y.
