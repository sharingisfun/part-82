She strips a branch of its leaves, chews the tip into a point and jams the tool into a hole in a tree, killing a bushbaby. In short, she has been making tools and using them to hunt.\n\nOnly humans are supposed to be capable of that. Anthropologist Jill Pruetz takes us deep into the fascinating world of the creatures she has studied for 9 years, giving us exclusive access to not only their groundbreaking hunting skills but their other strangely human ways. They spend most of their days on the ground, they splash in swimming holes and they even curl up in caves to sleep.\n\n \nWith the help of experts on our earliest ancestors and newly discovered evidence of the chimp stone age, we take an eye-opening scientific journey that reveals as much about ourselves as it does about the remarkable chimps of Fongoli.\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by : Lance Lewman \n==========================\n\n\nProduced &amp; Written by: Eleanor Grant \n====================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    The Changing Ape\nYear.................:    2010\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:50:17\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    704x400\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1947 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A)\nFile Size:...........:    700 MB\nFPS..................:    25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2010\n\n\n\n\n   \n  \n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         **** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58e9946942f6debd079edb54a90954713331af52","amp;dn":"The+Changing+Ape-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58e9946942f6debd079edb54a90954713331af52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,233,148,105,66,246,222,189,7,158,219,84,169,9,84,113,51,49,175,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
