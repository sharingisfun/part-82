It was later repeated in 1984 with an update on the platoon members' lives in the last episode.\nWritten and presented by the late Glyn Worsnip, [1] it was shot in the fly on the wall style, giving the viewing public a unique insight to military life. The programme's timing could not have been better as it began filming just prior to the onset of hostilities of the 1982 Falklands War. The series was accompanied by a book of the same name written by the principal researcher Frank Hilton [2]\nThe series was accompanied by a score of military music written and arranged by Conn Bernard.\nSome of those recruits passing out in 1982 went on to have long and distinguished careers including Dean Ward and Rod Stoner.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10ada0185a32d2ccf395b7687aaa30f847ec12e8","amp;dn":"The+Paras-Special+Forces+documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10ada0185a32d2ccf395b7687aaa30f847ec12e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,173,160,24,90,50,210,204,243,149,183,104,122,170,48,248,71,236,18,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
