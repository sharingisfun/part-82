After the\nsermon the evangelist pleaded with the reporter not to publish\nin the local paper any of the jokes he had used that night since\nhe was going to use the same stories the following night at the\nother church. The next morning the reporter published an\nexcellent review of the evangelist's message and concluded\nwith these words: &quot;The Reverend Mr. Franklin also told many\nstories that cannot be published.&quot;\nWhat follows is a collection of stories that definitely can be\npublished! Here are nearly three thousand of my all-time\nfavorite anecdotes, jokes, and witty comments about virtually\nevery topic under the sun.

It is life-affirming and life-giving. And it is, to\nborrow a word from religion, prophetic. It comforts the afflicted\nand afflicts the comfortable. It ennobles our spirits and extends\nour love to others.\nAnd, above all,","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74bd082778b6ec7c195fd70ae41ce7cef563d0b5","amp;dn":"An+Encyclopedia+of+Humor.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74bd082778b6ec7c195fd70ae41ce7cef563d0b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,189,8,39,120,182,236,124,25,95,215,10,228,28,231,206,245,99,208,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
