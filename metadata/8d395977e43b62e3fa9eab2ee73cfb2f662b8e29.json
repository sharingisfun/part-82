Giving up on all hope, Kevin hangs around, waiting for the end to come. As he does so, however, he meets a dog and cat who can talk. Apparently, the pets have come together to form an alliance as they search for a way to save their masters, and they need his help...seeing that he\\'s pretty much the only one still awake.\n\nBut as they begin their investigation into the weird sleeping phenomenon, they are warned of a great danger: the forest animals are mobilizing and they intend to keep the humans asleep...for good.\n\nJoined by a few drowsy classmates and some furry pals, Kevin must fend off hordes of wild animals and stay awake long enough to solve this mystery--or he too will fall asleep...and never awaken.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d395977e43b62e3fa9eab2ee73cfb2f662b8e29","amp;dn":"Awake+-+Sci-fi%2FFantasy+Novel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d395977e43b62e3fa9eab2ee73cfb2f662b8e29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,57,89,119,228,59,98,227,250,158,171,46,231,60,251,47,102,43,142,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
