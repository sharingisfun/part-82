The Roman Empire stretches from Egypt to Spain, and East as far as the Black Sea. But in northern Britain, the relentless onslaught of conquest has ground to a halt in face of the guerrilla tactics of an elusive enemy: the savage and terrifying Picts. Quintus Dias (Fassbender), sole survivor of a Pictish raid on a Roman frontier fort, marches north with General Virilus' (West) legendary Ninth Legion, under orders to wipe the Picts from the face of the earth and destroy their leader Gorlacon. But when the legion is ambushed on unfamiliar ground, and Virilus taken captive, Quintus faces a desperate struggle to keep his small platoon alive behind enemy lines. Enduring the harsh terrain and evading their remorseless Pict pursuers led by revenge-hungry Pict Warrior Etain (Kurylenko), the band of soldiers race to rescue their General and to reach the safety of the Roman frontier.\n\n[img]http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/2346/ce4a.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\n[img]http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/7495/ce1.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\n[img]http://img839.imageshack.us/img839/6522/ce2.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\n[img]http://signatures.mylivesignature.com/54488/175/E4FA621861A51E09B44842B10595E2EB.png[/img]\n\n\n\n\nGreetz to Fabreezy ,Imagine ,Flawl3ss ,Santi ,Vision ,Kingdom ,Tank66 ,Xclusive66 ,Prism ,Noir ,BDK ,TA and all other uploaders who serve the community\n\nThanks to Prism for the source \n\nBasically just done this because i had my other up pulled.Ive added abit more colour anyway and reduced the AR and not alot more .Videos good audio is okay .........\n\nThis isnt on the server so its going to be a slower one im afraid but if you help me out by setting your upload speed right we'll get there in the end ..\n\nEnjoy \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00c15a706b38c57777f611ab8e2fdddccbd230fb","amp;dn":"Centurion+XviD+CAM+SAFCuk009%2BFabreezy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00c15a706b38c57777f611ab8e2fdddccbd230fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,193,90,112,107,56,197,119,119,246,17,171,142,47,221,220,203,210,48,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
