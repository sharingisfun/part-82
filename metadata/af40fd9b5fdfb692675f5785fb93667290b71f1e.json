The first incarnation of the group began as the backing band for a show in the Hotel los Capelles in Santa Clara circa 1962; \nthe current lineup was formed when the owner of the hotel asked saxophonist/leader Juan Jose Bringuez  for a smaller group in order to play in some of the places that more tourists frequented. Unique musical time travelers, they perform African and Spanish-influenced songs from the '30s, '40s, and '50s. \nAmazingly, the classic nature of the tunes fits perfectly into the modern tastes for all things Latin and true to the heart. The kickoff piece, &quot;Suavecito,&quot; is a gentle, folksy piece featuring the soulful conversation between the sax and romantic vocalist Martin Chavez. &quot;Mata Siguaraya&quot; has a marching percussion beat, a lush acoustic guitar line, and some distant but emotional vocalizations. \nThere are a great deal of lively dance numbers led by fiery sax and spicy vocal harmonies, but a few are reserved for the slow dancers, like the graceful &quot;Dulce Desengano.&quot; (AMG)\n\n\n\n\n01.
