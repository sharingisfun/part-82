Trower, launched his career in\nthe 60s with band Procol Harum, he then went onto launch his solo career\nsigned to Chrysalis records.\n\nRobin Trower initially found fame in the late 1960s as the guitarist with\nProcol Harum, recording six albums before embarking on a solo career in\n1973. Forming the Robin Trower Band with Scottish bassist and vocalist\nJames Dewar, formerly a member of Frankie Miller's band as well as Stone\nThe Crows, and drummer Reg Isidore, this line-up recorded Trower's debut\nTwice Removed From Yesterday in 1973, followed by his breakthrough hit\nBridge Of Sighs the following year. With a title track later covered by both\nMetallica and Opeth, the album was a US Top 10 hit. Reg Isidore was\nreplaced by former Gypsy and Sly And The Family Stone drummer Bill\nLordan for 1975's For Earth Below, which, like Robin Trower's previous three\nalbums was produced by former Procol band-mate Matthew Fischer.\nOriginally recorded for radio broadcast on the Swedish Broadcasting\nCorporation at Stockholm's Concert Hall on 3rd February 1975, Robin\nTrower Live captures the power trio at the height of their collective powers,\nwith Dewar's bluesey vocals and Trower's Hendrix inspired guitar licks to the\nfore. This set is completed by their fifth release, 1976's Long Misty Days. A\nTale Untold: The Chrysalis Years 1973-1976 is augmented by the rare bside,\n'Take A Fast Train', single edits of 'Day of The Eagle', and 'Long Misty\nDays', previously unavailable on CD, and finishes with the previously\nunreleased 'Let Me Be The One', a rare outtake from Long Misty Days.\n\nThis 3cd box set contains his five Chrysalis albums between 1973 -1976\nplus bonus tracks ÃƒÂ¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b180765c158a1279af598c09f8cea98265cd359","amp;dn":"Robin+Trower+-+A+Tale+Untold+-+2010+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b180765c158a1279af598c09f8cea98265cd359","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,24,7,101,193,88,161,39,154,245,152,192,159,140,234,152,38,92,211,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
