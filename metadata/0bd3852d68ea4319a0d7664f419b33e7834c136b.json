Frogg Cafe's music is also peppered with an appealing variety of other flavors including latin music, bluegrass, modern chamber music and avant-garde/experimental. Their energetic live shows feature extended flights of group improvisation that would draw grins from any hardcore jam-band fan.&quot;\n( Cited from their homepage - http://www.froggcafe.com/bio.php )\n\nFrogg Cafe's lastest album Bateless Edge is easily their most ambitious effort to date and deserves far more attention than it will probably receive.\nUntil now (October 2010) Batless Edge is the top-rated prog album of 2010 in http://www.progarchives.com.\n\nZappa followers, listeners of jazz influenced prog or just lovers of well elaborated and exciting music should be prepared for several surprises. Highly recommended.\n\n\nreleased: 07/2010\nplaying time: 77:13\n\ncover and booklet included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bd3852d68ea4319a0d7664f419b33e7834c136b","amp;dn":"Frogg+Cafe+-+2010+-+Bateless+Edge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bd3852d68ea4319a0d7664f419b33e7834c136b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,211,133,45,104,234,67,25,160,215,102,79,65,155,51,231,131,76,19,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
