Finnegan examines well-known examples of False Flag terror, and adds an excellent new sequence about the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that leaves the viewer with no doubt that Emad Salem was a controlled asset. Utilizing audio that features Salem covertly recorded while talking with FBI agent John Anticev, &quot;Fool Me Twice&quot; cuts to the chase regarding the 1993 bombing, and goes deeper, examining the CIA's links to this milieu.\n\nThe Bali bombings are dissected with a healthy dose of newly gathered evidence that shows what the real effects of ANFO car bombs are, what they do, and what they don't do, like leave massive craters. The film argues that this is from high-intensity military-grade explosives, which the authorities declare were not used. At least not anymore. At first they claimed that Semtex and C4 were identified, but this didn't fit the official story in the hopper, which required that the bombers be tied to the purchase of ANFO making materials. This analysis of the bombing is brilliant indeed. In a short detour, the film explores evidence that some sort of nuclear device may have been used, however, no physical evidence is produced that could definitively prove that a nuclear device was used. \n\nXvid (Perian), 640 ÃƒÆ’","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c77c5bb9d44c07981e69dc6ec65c5fee52a295c","amp;dn":"Fool+Me+Twice+-+Bali+Bombings+%26+East+Timor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c77c5bb9d44c07981e69dc6ec65c5fee52a295c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,119,197,187,157,68,192,121,129,230,157,198,236,101,197,254,229,42,41,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
