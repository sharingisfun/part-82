The President of the       \n   United States, George W. Bush, claimed he wanted to remove a         \n   dictator who is armed with weapons of mass destruction, and liberate \n   a people. Instead the invasion provoked a bloody insurgency          \n   resulting in the death of thousands of civilians, massive troop      \n   casualties, and at the same time laying the ground-work for the      \n   arrival of Al Qaeda in Iraq.                                         \n   Made for Quicksilver productions by                                  \n   producer Sam Collyns, the series tells the story of Iraq not simply  \n   from the point of view of the invaders but from the insurgents who   \n   fought them. It tells how fundamental strategic mistakes made by the \n   Americans pushed formerly peaceful Iraqis into the arms of the       \n   fanatical Al                                                         \n   Qaeda.                                                               \n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2010/s3032216.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2010/s3032216.htm&lt;/a&gt;             \n                                                                        \n                                                                        \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n   100Mbit+ Affil sites (w/ archives)                                   \n   Broadcast/Network/PPV Cappers (US/UK/Aus) with PDTV/HDTV Sources     \n   People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping            \n   TV/WWE/MMA DVD Rippers/Suppliers                                     \n   Dump/Uplink/Shell Providers                                          \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;364102505544534176515b575f5a1855595b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   All of you hobos keeping the UK and Sports scenes alive &lt;3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f97765ca48dab5160f14b4e2d39d6390cc660411","amp;dn":"Four.Corners.2010.10.11.Secret.Iraq.Part1.Insurgency.WS.PDTV.Xvi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f97765ca48dab5160f14b4e2d39d6390cc660411","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,119,101,202,72,218,181,22,15,20,180,226,211,157,99,144,204,102,4,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
