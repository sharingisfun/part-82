And it's a great concert! Meat sounds good and the show is just fantastic. 105 minutes of pure rock with 4 great new songs from the latest album and a bunch of his greatest hits make this a concert to remember!\n\nBecause there is no official or complete bootleg version from the show I had to create it myself!\n\nThere have been a lot of lose clips from the concerts floating on the web lately. So I decided to collect them and make one big concert out of them.\n\nI used two audio sources for this dvd. \nMost of the sound is from the bootleg cd from the 'Mohegan Sun Casino'. It was taped on july 12th from the audience. Very good quality for a fan recording.\n\nSecond source is the House of Blues in Texas concert from August 26. I used that mainly for the talk with the audience stuff (some very funny stuff in here).\n\nThen I used video sources from:\nFantasy Springs Resort Casino, Indio\nGibson Amphitheatre, California\nSeminole Hardrock in Hollywood, Florida\nHouse of Blues, Texas\nPNC Bank Arts Centre, New Jersey \n\nAnd I started mixing them together. It's all audience video recordings so don't expect professional quality here.\n\nI grabbed all the clips I had and started to lypsinc them with the sound. And for most part I think I succeeded.\n\nWhat's left is a 110 minute concert giving you a very good impression of Meat's current tour. \n\nThis is the ultimate version. I won't be making any changes to this concert. Added new scenes for Bat out of Hell, Two out of Three en Anything for love. Fixed a few more lip sync issues and now it should work well! \n\nCredits go to the fans that video/audio taped the material I used.\n\nTracklist:\n01. Intro\n02. Hot Patootie\n03. Bat out of Hell\n04. Peace on Earth\n05. Living on the Outside\n06. Los Angeloser\n07. You Took the Words\n08. Song of Madness\n09. Rock 'n Roll Dreams\n10. Anything for Love\n11. Audience Talk\n12. Two Out of Three\n13. Paradise by the Dashboard Light\n14.
