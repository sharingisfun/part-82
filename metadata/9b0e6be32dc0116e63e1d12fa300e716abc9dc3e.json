Jimmy Eat World has a\nstellar history across Modern Rock radio with five top 10 hits.\n\nInvented marks the band's first studio album since 2007's Chase This Light which\nlanded Jimmy Eat World's highest chart position of their career at #5 on the\nBillboard 200 Album Chart. Jimmy Eat World's last release may have been three\nyears ago but they've been busy. The boys took a break from the recording of\nInvented to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of their influential album,\nClarity with a sold out national tour.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nInfo:\n\nLike it?
