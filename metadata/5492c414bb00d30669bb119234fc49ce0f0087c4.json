But \n\nthese guys do a super groove version of the Les McCann/Eddie Harris hit \n\nCompared To What. Some hot trumpet playing c/o of Jon Birdsong who \n\nhas spent the past 3 years playing with Beck. And Michael Bluestein does \n\nsome wicked piano playing and analog synth - that gives the song sort of \n\na space rock overtone. The rest of the CD is all instrumental that is in \n\n1970's Krautrock meets soul jazz vibe and includes a REMIX by Krautrock \n\nlegends FAUST and one by Tortoise/Gastr del Sol man Bundy K Brown. \n\nThe Bundy K Brown mix sounds like a mix of electronica and early Pink \n\nFloyd. very trippy and weird and is about 20 mins long ! overall a great CD \n\nfor jamming, tripping and dancing&quot;.
