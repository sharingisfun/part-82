In Jamaican history, the roots of radical protest, a national identity and the Rastafari movement, grew from communities formed by escaped slaves in the hills and (after emancipation in 1838) the so-called &quot;Free Villages&quot;.\n      &quot;Legalize It&quot; is an album by Peter Tosh. It was his debut album as a solo artist.

It was produced by Joe Gibbs using a re-recording of the riddim of the 1967 Alton Ellis' song &quot;I'm Still In Love&quot;, which had already been re-popularised in the 1970s by Marcia Aitken's cover &quot;I'm Still In Love With You Boy&quot; and the deejay track &quot;Three Piece Suit&quot; by Trinity, to which &quot;Uptown&quot; was an 'answer record'. They released the album of the same name in 1978, on which they are backed by The Revolutionaries, on the Virgin Records subsidiary Front Line, and several more singles, but never met with any more tangible success thereafter.\n     Judy Mowatt started her career as part of the all-female singing group, The Gaylettes in 1967.

AFRICAN TRADITIONAL MUSIC   ( deep roots )  \n\n         African music has been a major factor in the shaping of what we know today as blues and jazz. These styles have all borrowed from African rhythms and sounds, brought over the Atlantic ocean by slaves. \n\n\n        THE ABYSSINIANS   -  SATTA MASSA GANA  \n        ANGELIQUE KIDJO - ZELIE (influenced by the trad. songs of Togo,W.Africa)\n\n\n\n ***********************************************************************************\n\n\n 02.  BLUES   \n\n           Important source of modern rock'n'roll, absolutely essential to the sound we think of as 60's rock, was, first, the Blues. Blues has evolved from an unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of African-American slaves (imported from West Africa; principally present day Mali, Senegal, the Gambia and Ghana).\n           Blues began as the music of black sharecroppers in the poor cotton-farming region of the Mississippi Delta, and traveled north to Chicago with the sharecroppers as thousands of them moved north in search of a better life. It was in Chicago that the blues went from acoustic solo guitar music to electric guitar-electric bass-drums combos.\n            Blues can be subdivided into several subgenres ranging from country to urban blues that were more or less popular during different periods of the 20th century. Best known are the Delta, Piedmont, Jump and Chicago blues styles. In the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form called blues rock evolved.\n\n\n02.01  Delta Blues artists - Prewar blues : \n \n             The Delta blues is one of the earliest styles of blues music. Guitar and harmonica are the dominant instruments used. &quot;Delta blues&quot; is a style as much as a geographical appellation: Skip James and Elmore James, who were not born in the Delta, were considered Delta blues musicians. Performers traveled throughout the Mississippi Delta, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Tennessee. Eventually, Delta blues spread out across the country, giving rise to a host of regional variations, including &quot;Chicago blues&quot; and &quot;Detroit blues&quot;. Muddy Waters, Little Milton, B.B. King, and Howlin' Wolf were just a few of these important Chicago blues artists. \n             List of artists : Ishman Bracey ,Willie Brown, Robert Johnson, Tommy Johnson, Blind Willie Johnson ,Paul Jones, R.L.

Electric blues used amplified electric guitars, electric bass, drums, and harmonica played through a microphone. Chicago became a center for electric blues in the early 1950s. Chicago blues is influenced to a large extent by the Mississippi blues style, because many performers had migrated from the Mississippi region. Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, and Jimmy Reed were all born in Mississippi and moved to Chicago during the Great Migration. \n\n\n         BIG BILL BROONZY  -  HEY HEY  (1952)\n         BIG BILL BROONZY  -  HOW YOU WANT IT DONE  (1952)\n         BIG BILL BROONZY  -  WORRIED MAN BLUES   (1952)\n         THE HOWLIN' WOLF  -   SMOKESTACK LIGHTNIN'  (1956)\n         SKIP JAMES  -  ALL NIGHT LONG \n         DR.

JAZZ  &amp;  SWING BANDS \n  \n              A jazz band (or jazz ensemble) is a musical ensemble that plays jazz music usually without a conductor. Jazz bands usually consist of a rhythm section and a horn section. The rhythm section of a jazz band consists of the percussion, double bass or bass guitar, and usually at least one instrument capable of playing chords, such as a piano, guitar,The horn section consists of wind and brass instruments, which play the melody and main accompaniment. Typical horns found in a big jazz band include 4 to 5 trumpets, saxophones (2-3 altos, 2 tenors, and a baritone), 3-4 trombones, and a bass trombone. \n              Swing music, also known as swing jazz or simply swing, is a form of jazz music that developed in the early 1930s and had solidified as a distinctive style by 1935 in the United States. Swing uses a strong anchoring rhythm section which supports a lead section that can include brass instruments, including trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophones and clarinets or stringed instruments including violin and guitar; medium to fast tempos; and a &quot;lilting&quot; swing time rhythm. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise a new melody over the arrangement. \n             Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, and Duke Ellington's bands are some of the most famous. Except for Duke Ellington, all those bands were primarily dance bands, with big swinging backbeats.\n\n\n03.01 Pre-war jazz\n\n          LOUIS ARMSTRONG &amp; HIS HOT FIVE  -  WEST END BLUES   (1928)\n          DUKE ELLINGTON  - BLACK &amp; TAN FANTASY  (1929)\n          DUKE ELLINGTON ORCHESTRA   (1930)  \n          MILLS BROTHER   - TIGER RAG  (1932) \n          MILLS BROTHER  -  SWING IT, SISTER   (1934)\n\n\n03.02 Post-war jazz\n\n          LOUIS ARMSTRONG -  WHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN (1956) \n          ANITA O'DAY   -  SWEET GEORGIA BROWN   (1958)\n          ANITA O'DAY   -  TEA FOR TWO  (1958)\n          NINA SIMONE  -  ERETS ZAVAT CHALAV   (1962)\n          NINA SIMONE  -  ZUNGO  (1962)\n          NINA SIMONE  -  I WANT A LITTLE SUGAR IN MY BOWL  (1967)\n          NINA SIMONE  -  BACKLASH BLUES  (1976)\n          NINA SIMONE  -  I WISH I KNEW HOW IT WOULD FEEL TO BE FREE  (1976)  \n          NINA SIMONE  -  WHAT YOU GONNA DO  (1982)\n          NINA SIMONE  -  MY BABY JUST CARES FOR ME   (1987)\n          NINA SIMONE  -  ROMEO AND JULIET  Fantasy Overture (Tchaikovsky)\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n         ***********************************************************************************    \n\n\n    \n    \n04.

At the same time, amusement, fun and lightness were cultivated in jazz and dancing, in defiance of the horrors of World War I, which remained present in people's minds. In music, the three sounds were jazz, jazz, and jazz. The period is also often called &quot;The Jazz Age&quot;. \n\n\n         SOPHIE TUCKER  -  SOME OF THESE DAYS   (1911)\n         MARION HARRIS  -  AFTER YOU'VE  GONE  (1918)\n         SOPHIE TUCKER  -  THE LAST OF THE RED HOT MAMAS  (1926)\n         MILTON AGER &amp; JACK YALLEN -  AIN'T SHE SWEET  (1927)\n         EDYTHE FLYNN - IS SHE MY MY GIRL FRIEND (How de-ow-dow)  (1927)         \n         MARION HARRIS   -  AFRAID OF YOU  (1929)\n         ANNETTE HANSHAW  -  FORGET ME NOT  (1929)\n         ANNETTE HANSHAW - DADDY WON'T YOU PLEASE COME HOME  (1929)\n         SOPHIE TUCKER  -  ONLY THE RIGHT MAN CAN DO ME WRONG   (1930)\n         MARION HARRIS  -  I'M FUNNY THAT WAY  (1930)\n         RUTH ETTING &amp; JAY VELIE  - ONE GOOD TURN  (1930)\n         RUTH ETTING  -  IF I COULD BE WITH YOU (1930)\n         RUTH ETTING  -  I'M FUNNY THAT WAY  (1931)\n         ANNETTE HANSHAW - WE JUST  COULDN'T SAY  GOODBYE  (1933)\n\n\n       \n04.02  Music of the 1930's and 40's\n\n            In the 1930ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and 40ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music and dancing was very popular.

COUNTRY MUSIC \n\n            Country music (or country and western) is a blend of popular musical forms originally found in the Southern United States and the Appalachian Mountains (Tennessee, Virginia, West Wirginia, and Kentucky). It has roots in traditional folk music, Celtic music, gospel music, and old-time music and evolved rapidly in the 1920s.\n\n05.01. Early recorded country music \n\n            The first commercial recording of what can be considered country music was &quot;Sallie Gooden&quot; by fiddlist A.C. Robertson in 1922. Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family are widely considered to be important early country musicians. Rodgers fused hillbilly country, gospel, jazz, blues, pop, cowboy, and folk; and many of his best songs were his compositions, including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlue YodelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which sold over a million records and established Rodgers as the premier singer of early country music.\n\n      \n          JIMMIE RODGERS   -   BLUE YODEL No. 1 (T For Texas)  (1928)\n          JIMMIE RODGERS   -   WAITING FOR A TRAIN   (1928) \n\n\n\n05.02 Country music 1930s-1960s\n\n            Many musicians performed and recorded songs in any number of styles. During the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or Western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood. Some of the popular singing cowboys from the era were Gene Autry, the Sons of the Pioneers and Roy Rogers .Country musicians began recording Boogie in 1939. During World WarII, honky tonk country was popularized by Ernest Tubb (&quot;I'm Walking The Floor Over You&quot;), who took the sound to Nashville, where he was the first musician to play electric guitar on Grand Ole Opry. In the 1950s, honky tonk entered its golden age, with the massive popularity of Webb Pierce, Hank Locklin, Lefty Frizzell, George Jones, and Hank Williams.\n           By the end of World War II, many musicians performed music known as bluegrass .In the post-war period, country music was called &quot;folk&quot; in the trades, and &quot;hillbilly&quot; within the industry.In 1944, Billboard replaced the term &quot;hillbilly&quot; with &quot;folk songs and blues,&quot; and switched to &quot;country&quot; or &quot;country and western&quot; in 1949 . Gospel music, too, remained a popular component of country music.\n\n\n           PATTI PAGE  -  TENNESSEE WALTZ  (1950)\n           MARILYN MONROE  -  RIVER OF NO RETURN  (1954)\n           HANK SNOW -  I DONÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢T HURT ANYMORE  (1956)\n           HANK SNOW  -  RUMBA BOOGIE   (1959)\n           JOHNNY CASH  - FIVE FEET HIGH AND RISIN  (1959)\n           CONNIE SMITH  - ONCE A DAY (1965)\n           TAMMY WYNETTE -  STAND BY YOUR MAN  (1968)\n                           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n05.03 Country music 1970s to the present :\n\n          Country rock is a musical genre formed from the fusion of rock with country music, with its country origins being initially referenced to the rockabilly music of the 1950s.List of artists : The Dillards, The Byrds, Gene Clark, Gram Parsons, Neil Young, Michael Nesmith, Grateful Dead, The Band, Bob Dylan, Buffalo Springfield, Moby Grape Area Code 615 and the Ozark Mountain Daredevils, The Flying Burrito Brothers, First National Band, The Eagles, Little Feat, Linda Ronstadt, Poco, Pure Prairie League, The Doobie Brothers, The Marshall Tucker Band and Barefoot Jerry,\n         Country pop, with roots in both the countrypolitan sound and in soft rock, is a subgenre of country music that first emerged in the 1970s.

THE FIFTIES\n\n\n           The 1950s offered a combination of sounds for everyone. Rock 'n roll, rhythm and blues, love songs, jazz (first Newport Festival), calypso (Harry Belafonte), and musicals were all popular.Records rather than air play began to determine the popularity of a song.  Hit makers were Johnny Ray, Patti Page, Nat King Cole, Teresa Brewer,Tony Bennett, Perry Como,  Pat Boone, Doris Day, Eddie Fisher, Frankie Laine, Dean Martin , and Peggy Lee. Groups were popular, including the Platters, Les Paul and Mary Ford, Ames Brothers , Four Aces, Buddy Holly and many others made the huge number of decade hits.In 1956, Elvis became the first rock star. Black recording artists Chuck Berry and Fats Domino became rock 'n roll stars. Color TV became a major influence, stereos were offered for sale, the first Grammy (1959) was given.  \n\n               \n         PEGGY LEE &amp; DAVE BARBOUR - I COVER THE WATERFRONT  (1950)\n         GENE KELLY  -   SINGINÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ IN THE RAIN  (1952)\n         DEAN MARTIN - THAT'S AMORE   (1953)\n         ROSEMARY CLOONEY  - MAMBO ITALIANO  (1954) \n         PEGGY LEE  -  JOHNNY GUITAR  (1955)        \n         DEAN MARTIN - MEMORIES ARE MADE OF THIS   (1956)\n         MARIO LANZA &amp; LUISA DI MEO   -   ARRIVEDERCI ROMA  (1958) \n         DOMENICO MODUGNO ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ VOLARE  (1958)\n         LOUIS PRIMA  - BUONA SERA SIGNORINA   (1958)\n         DEAN MARTIN  -  MAMBO ITALIANO \n         DEAN MARTIN  -  Medley : VOLARE &amp; EVENING IN ROMA   \n         DEAN MARTIN &amp; RICKY NELSON - MY RIFLE, MY PONY AND ME- Rio Bravo (1959)\n         DARIO MORENO  -  MUSTAPHA   (1960) \n         PEGGY LEE &amp; FRANK SINATRA - NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT   (1962)\n         DEAN MARTIN  -  EVERYBODY LOVES SOMEBODY  (1964)\n         \n\n       \n\n 06.01  POP MUSIC - &quot;Before-Beatles&quot; period  \n\n         ELVIS PRESLEY -  LOVE ME  (1956)\n         ELVIS PRESLEY -  LOVE ME TENDER  (1956)\n         ELVIS PRESLEY -  DON'T BE CRUEL  (1956)\n         RICKY NELSON  -  A TEENAGER'S  ROMANCE  (1957)\n         RICKY NELSON  - BYE BYE LOVE (1957)\n         ELVIS PRESLEY -  TEDDY BEAR  (1957)\n         RICKY NELSON  - LONESOME TOWN  (1958)\n         ELVIS PRESLEY  -  TROUBLE   (1958)  \n         CLIFF RICHARD &amp; THE SHADOWS -  LIVING DOLL   (1959)\n         CLIFF RICHARD &amp; THE SHADOWS -  TRAVELLIN' LIGHT  (1959)  \n         CLIFF RICHARD &amp; THE  SHADOWS  - LOVE (1959)\n         EDDIE COCHRAN - TEENAGE HEAVEN  (1959) \n         PAUL ANKA  -  LONELY BOY  (1959)\n         CLIFF RICHARD &amp; THE SHADOWS -  THE YOUNG ONES  (1960)\n         ELVIS PRESLEY  -  WOODEN HEART (1960)\n         ROY ORBISON  -  ONLY THE LONLEY  (1960)\n         ROY ORBISON  - RUNNING SCARED   (1961)\n         RICKY NELSON  -  TRAVELING MAN  (1961)\n         ELVIS PRESLEY  - CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE  (1961)\n         BRIAN HYLAND  - SEALED WITH A KISS   (1962)\n         RICKY NELSON  -  YOUNG WORLD  (1962)\n         RICKY NELSON  -  IT'S UP TO YOU  (1962)\n         RICKY NELSON  -  I WILL FOLLOW YOU  (1963)\n         TRINI LOPEZ  -  AMERICA  (1963)\n\n\n\n\n\n          06.02  ROCK AND ROLL &amp; ROCKABILLY \n\n          Rock and roll  is a genre of popular music that evolved in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Its roots lay mainly in blues, rhythm and blues, country, folk, gospel, and jazz. The style subsequently spread to the rest of the world and developed further, leading ultimately to modern rock music. \n          Rockabilly is one of the earliest styles of rock and roll music, and emerged in the early 1950s. The term rockabilly is a portmanteau of rock and hillbilly, the latter a reference to the country music (often called hillbilly music in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style's development. Other important influences on rockabilly include western swing, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues. Many  popular rock and roll singers of the time, such as Fats Domino, Chuck Berry and Little Richard, came out of the black rhythm and blues tradition, making the music attractive to white audiences, and are not usually classed as &quot;rockabilly&quot;.\n          Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Roy Orbison, Sam Cooke, The Coasters, Carl Perkins, Buddy Holly, Billy Haley &amp; The Comets, The Everly Brothers, Rickie Nelson, Little Richard, LaVern Baker .............\n\n\n         BILL HAYLEY &amp; HIS COMETS  -  ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK  (1954)\n         CHUCK BERRY -  MAYBELLENE (1955)\n         BO DIDDLEY - BO DIDDLEY  (1955)\n         GENE VINCENT  -  BE-BOP-A-LULA  (1956)\n         LITTLE RICHARD  -  LONG TALL SALLY   (1956)\n         ELVIS PRESLEY - HEARTBREAK HOTEL (1956)\n         ELVIS PRESLEY - HOUND DOG  (1956) \n         EDDIE COCHRAN  -  TWENTY FLIGHT ROCK  (1956)\n         ELVIS PRESLEY   -   JAILHOUSE ROCK  (1957)   \n         ELVIS PRESLEY  - TOO MUCH  (1957)\n         BUDDY HOLLY &amp; THE CRICKETS  -  PEGGY SUE  (1957)\n         EDDIE COCHRAN -  SUMMERTIME BLUES  (1958)\n         EDDIE COCHRAN - C'MON EVERYBODY   (1958)\n         JERRY LEE LEWIS  -  BREATHLESS  (1958)\n         CARL PERKINS  -  GLAD ALL OVER  (1958)\n         DANNY  &amp; THE JUNIORS  - ROCK  &amp; ROLL IS HERE TO STAY   (1958)\n         DUANNE EDDY -  REBEL ROUSER  (1958)\n         CHUCK BERRY  -  JOHNNY B.GOODE  (1958) \n\n\n\n\n\n          06.03  ROCKABILLY  REVIVAL \n\n        Rockabilly Revival early 1970s  (return to the simple, loud, fast, emotionally-direct music of early rock and roll). Some musicians stripped their sound down to three chords, loud guitars, and shouted lyrics, creating early punk rock. Other musicians turned back to the original rock and roll music of the 1950s for inspiration, and in the late 1970s, an underground rockabilly revival began to emerge.  \n\n\n         BO DIDDLEY  -  HEY BO DIDDLEY   (1969)\n         THE HOUSESHAKERS  -  BE-BOP-A-LULA (1972)\n         HEINZ BURT  -  C'MON EVERYBODY  (1972)\n         BO DIDDLEY  -  ROAD RUNNER   (1972)\n         BILL HAYLEY &amp; HIS COMETS  - ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK  (1972) \n         LITTLE RICHARD - LUCILLE  (1972) \n         BO DIDDLEY  -  BO DIDDLEY   (1985)\n         BO DIDDLEY  -  BO PUT THE ROCK IN ROCK &amp; ROLL  (1985)\n         BO DIDDLEY  -  GUNSLINGER  (1985)\n         CHUCK BERRY  -  BIO  (1986)\n         CHUCK BERRY  -  CAROL  (1987)\n         CHUCK BERRY  -  ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN  (1987)\n\n\n\n\n06.04. DOO-WOP \n\n           Doo-wop is a style of vocal-based rhythm and blues music, which developed in African-American communities in the 1940s and which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1950s and 1960s With its smooth, consonant vocal harmonies, doo-wop was one of the most mainstream, pop-oriented R&amp;B styles of the 1950s and 1960s.. There is confusion regarding which recording was the &quot;first&quot; to contain the phrase &quot;doo-wop&quot;. There is general acknowledgement that the first hit record to use the syllables &quot;doo-wop&quot; in the refrain was the 1955 hit, &quot;When You Dance&quot; by The Turbans, in which the chant &quot;doo-wop&quot; can clearly be heard . Important African American doo-wop groups included The Marcels, The Coasters, The Drifters, The Moonglows, Clovers,  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Little Anthony and the Imperials,The &quot;5&quot; Royales , The Flamingos , The Dells, The Cadillacs, The Midnighters and The Platters.\n\n\n         THE PLATTERS   -  ONLY YOU  (1956)\n         THE PLATTERS   -  SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES  (1958) \n         JACKIE WILSON  - LONELY TEARDROPS   (1958)\n         JACKIE WILSON  - I'M COMINÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ON BACK TO YOU  (1961) \n         GENE CHANDLER -  DUKE OF EARL\n         THE PLATTERS  - THE GREAT PRETENDER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06.05. SOUL MUSIC \n\n         Soul music has its roots in gospel music and rhythm and blues. The hard gospel vocal quartets of the 1940s and 1950s were big influences on major soul singers of the 1960s. Many consider the birthplace of soul music to be northern United States inner cities, particularly Chicago. Other cities, such as New York, Detroit, Memphis and Florence, quickly followed, creating their own soul styles based on their regional gospel roots. Sam Cook, Ray Charles Solomon Burke, Little Richard, James Brown,Fats Domino and  Aretha Franklin  are considered to be one of the pioneers and founders of soul music. \n     \n          SAM COOKE  -  YOU SEND ME  (1965)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07. THE SIXTIES  (the decade of 1960-1969)\n\n\n           The sixties were the decade of  Pop Music, Protest Songs, protesting the war, Rhythm and Blues, Motown, musicals, and the Beatles. In 1969, Woodstock was attended by 300,000.  A three day even for peace, love and rock took place. Performers included Janis Joplin, Sly and the Family Stone,  Led Zepplin, The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane ............... \n\n  \n \nThe 1960's Begin:  \n\n\n07.01.00.  BRITISH ROCK IN THE 1960s \n\n          British rock describes a wide variety of forms of music made in the United Kingdom. Since around 1964, with the &quot;British Invasion&quot; of the United States spearheaded by The Beatles, British rock music has had a considerable impact on the development of American music and rock music across the world. British rock has produced many of the most significant groups and performers in rock music internationally, and has initiated or significantly developed many of the most influential sub-genres, including beat music, progressive rock, heavy metal music, punk, post punk, new romanticism, and indie rock.\n\n\n07.01.01  BRITISH BEAT BANDS, BEATLEMANIA AND THE ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBRITISH INVASIONÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n       British beat is a rock music genre that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1960s. Beat music is a fusion of rock and roll, doo wop, skiffle, R&amp;B and soul. The beat movement provided most of the bands responsible for the British invasion of the American pop charts in the period after 1964, and provided the model for many important developments in pop and rock music.\n      Beatlemania is a term that originated during the 1960s to describe the intense fan frenzy directed toward The Beatles during the early years of their success, particularly by teenage girls. The word is a portmanteau of &quot;Beatles&quot; and &quot;mania&quot;. Andi Lothian, a former Scottish music promoter, claims that he coined the term while speaking to a reporter at the Caird Hall Beatles concert that took place as part of the Beatles Mini-Tour of Scotland, on 7 October 1963,\n        On 7 February 1964, the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite ran a story about The  Beatles' United States arrival in which the correspondent said &quot;The British Invasion this time     goes by the code name Beatlemania&quot;. Other acts that were part of the &quot;invasion&quot; included \nPeter and Gordon, The Animals, Manfred Mann, Petula Clark, Freddie and the Dreamers, Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, Herman's Hermits, The Rolling Stones, The Troggs,  Donovan ,The Who, The Kinks, and The Dave Clark Five;\n\n\n\n         THE SHADOWS  -  APACHE  (1960)\n         THE SHADOWS - FBI   (1961)\n         THE BEATLES  -  HAMBURG / (ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN) (1961)\n         TONY SHERIDAN &amp; THE BEATLES  -  AIN'T SHE SWEET  (1961)\n         TONY SHERIDAN &amp; THE BEATLES  - MY BONNIE   (1961)\n         TONY SHERIDAN &amp; THE BEATLES  -  KANSAS CITY   (1962)\n         TONY SHERIDAN &amp; THE BEATLES  -  SWEET GEORGIA BROWN  (1962)\n         TONY SHERIDAN &amp; THE BEATLES  - RUBY BABY  (1962)\n         THE BEATLES -  SOME OTHER GUY  (1962)\n         THE BEATLES - LOVE ME DO  (1962)\n         THE BEATLES  -  PLEASE, PLEASE ME (1962)     \n         THE BEATLES  -  SHE LOVES YOU (1963)\n         THE ROLLING STONES  -  I WANNA BE YOUR MAN   (1963)\n         THE BEATLES  -  I WANNA BE YOUR MAN   (1963)\n         THE BEATLES   -  TILL THERE WAS YOU  (1963)  \n         THE BEATLES  -   BABY ITÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S YOU  (1963)\n         THE BEATLES  -  I SAW HER STANDING THERE (1963)\n         THE BEATLES - TWIST AND SHOUT (1963)\n         THE BEATLES  -  FROM ME TO YOU  (1964)\n         THE ROLLING STONES -  AROUND AND AROUND  (1964)\n         THE BEATLES  -  KANSAS CITY  Hey!

During the 1960s, pychedelic rock dominated the later half of the decade with bands such as The Doors, Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, and The Jimi Hendrix Experience obtaining success. Other artists to achieve success included folk rocker Bob Dylan, surf rock band The Beach Boys, and southern rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival.\n\n\n07.02.01.  SURF MUSIC \n\n         Surf music is a genre of popular music associated with surf culture, particularly Orange County and other areas of Southern California. It was particularly popular between 1961 and 1965, has subsequently been revived and was highly influential on subsequent rock music. Although beginning as a purely instrumental form, surf music achieved its greatest commercial success as vocal music. Most associated with this movement were the Beach Boys. Other vocal surf acts followed, including one-hit wonders like Ronny &amp; the Daytonas with &quot;G. T. O.&quot; (1964) and the Rip Chords with &quot;Hey Little Cobra&quot;, which both reached the top ten, but the only other act to achieve sustained success with the formula were Jan &amp; Dean, who had a number 1 hit with &quot;Surf City&quot;.\n\n         THE BEACH BOYS  -  SURFINÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ SAFARI   (1962)\n         THE BEACH BOYS  -  WHEN I GROW UP  (To Be A Man) (1964)\n         THE BEACH BOYS  -  I GET AROUND  (1964)\n         THE BEACH BOYS -   I GET AROUND  (1964) ( 2nd version)\n         THE BEACH BOYS  -  SLOOP JOHN B.

The genre was pioneered  by the Los Angeles band The Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and Bob Dylan penned material with rock instrumentation, in a style heavily influenced by The Beatles and other British bands. The term &quot;folk rock&quot; was itself first used by the U.S. music press to describe The Byrds' music in June 1965, the same month that the band's debut album was issued. Inspired by British psychedelic folk and the North-American style of folk rock, Pentangle, Fairport, and other related bands began to incorporate elements of traditional British folk music into their repertoire.\n\n\n         BOB DYLAN - WITH GOD ON OUR SIDE  (1964)\n         PETER ,PAUL &amp; MARY -  IF I HAD A HAMMER  (1964)\n         BOB DYLAN -  SUBTERRANEAN HOMESICK BLUES  (1965)\n         BOB DYLAN -  IT'S ALL OVER NOW, BABY BLUE  (1965)\n         BOB DYLAN -  MAGGIE'S FARM  (1965)\n         THE BYRDS  -  MR.

BRITISH BLUES BOOM  ( late 1950s and early 1960s )\n\n         In parallel with beat music, in the late 1950s and early 1960s a British blues scene was developing recreating the sounds of American R&amp;B and later particularly the sounds of bluesmen Robert Johnson, Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters. Initially led by purist blues followers such as Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies, it reached its height of mainstream popularity in the 1960s, when it developed a distinctive and influential style dominated by electric guitar and made international stars of several proponents of the genre including The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds, Eric Clapton, Fleetwood Mac and Led Zeppelin. A number of these moved through Blues-rock to different forms of rock music, with increasing emphasis on technical virtuosity and improvisational skills. As a result British blues helped to form many of the sub-genres of rock, including psychedelic rock and heavy metal music. Since then direct interest in the blues in Britain has declined, but many of the key performers have returned to it in recent years, new acts have emerged and there have been a renewed interest in the genre.\n\n\n          THE ROLLING STONES  -  LITTLE RED ROOSTER   (1964)\n          THE YARDBIRDS  (with Eric Clapton)  -  I WISH YOU WOULD (1964)\n          FLEETWOOD MAC  -  MY HEART BEAT LIKE A HAMMER  (1968)\n\n\n\n\n\n07.04.00.  BLUES ROCK AND HARD ROCK IN THE 1960s\n\n\n         Blues-rock is a hybrid musical genre combining bluesy improvisations over the 12-bar blues and extended boogie jams with rock and roll styles. The style began to develop in the mid-1960s in England and the United States, While the early blues-rock bands &quot;attempted to play long, involved improvisations which were commonplace on jazz records&quot;, by the 1970s, blues rock got heavier and more riff-based. By the &quot;early '70s, the lines between blues-rock and hard rock were barely visible&quot;\n\n         Hard rock (or heavy rock) is a loosely defined genre of rock music which has its earliest roots in mid-1960s garage, blues rock and psychedelic rock. It is typified by a heavy use of distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and sometimes pianos and keyboards. One of the major influences of hard rock is blues music. American and British rock bands began to modify rock and roll, adding to the standard genre harder sounds, heavier guitar riffs, bombastic drumming and louder vocals. This sound created the basis for hard rock. Hard rock emerged with groups of the late-1960s, such as The Who, Deep Purple, Iron Butterfly, Blue Cheer, Vanilla Fudge, and Led Zeppelin who mixed the music of early rock bands with a more hard-edged form of blues rock and acid rock.\n         Later, Jimi Hendrix produced a form of blues-influenced psychedelic rock, which combined elements of jazz, blues and rock and roll. He was one of the first guitarists to experiment with new guitar effects like phasing, feedback and distortion, after guitarists such as Link Wray, Dave Davies of the Kinks, Pete Townshend of The Who, Eric Clapton of Cream and Jeff Beck of The Yardbirds.\n\n\n         THE KINKS  -  YOU REALLY GOT ME  (1964)\n         CREAM  -  SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE (1967)\n          CREAM  -  WHITE ROOM   (1968)\n          STEPPENWOLF  - BORN TO BE WILD (1968)\n          VANILLA FUDGE  - YOU KEEP ME HANGIN' ON  (1968)\n          BLIND FAITH - UNDER MY THUMB  (1969)\n          BLIND FAITH  -  DO WHAT YOU LIKE  (1969)\n          FLEETWOOD MAC - OH WELL  (1969)  \n          THE  DOORS - WILD CHILD  (1969)\n          JANIS JOPLIN - SUMMERTIME (1969)\n          JANIS JOPLIN - SUMMERTIME (1969) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Stockholm\n\n\n\n\n\n07.05.00.  PSYCHODELIC POP AND ROCK \n\n           Psychedelic rock evolved in the 60s as an offshoot of the rock and roll movement combining elements of pop,rock, electronic music, eastern influences - particularly sitars, and other diverse elements. Inspired by the use of mind altering drugs like cannabis, mescaline, psilocybin, and especially LSD, psychedelic rock broke with traditional rock and laid the roots for Krautrock and experimental rock genres of the seventies and eighties. Psychedelic music could be interpreted as simply a &quot;surreal and dreamy feeling&quot; in a particular song, instead of a specific genre with rules to follow. In some cases, this simply requires writing one coherent song, then to experiment recording that song in the studio while under &quot;psychedelic influence&quot;, yielding very surreal musical results.\n        Psychedelic pop is a musical style inspired by the harder, louder songs of psychedelic rock but applied more to a pop music setting.\n\n\n         PINK FLOYD     -  SEE EMILY PLAY  (1967)\n         JEFFERSON AIRPLANE - WHITE RABBIT ( 1967)\n         THE BEATLES  -  I AM THE WALRUS  (1967)\n         THE BEATLES  - BLUE JAY WAY  (1967)\n         TRAFFIC - HOLE IN MY SHOE   (1967)\n         THE ROLLING STONES - WE LOVE YOU  (1967)\n         THE ROLLING STONES -  2000 LIGHT YEARS FROM HOME  (1967)\n         PINK FLOYD   -  INTERSTELLAR OVERDRIVE  (1967)\n         THE DOORS - THE CRYSTAL SHIP   (1967)\n         TRAFFIC  -  PAPER SUN  (1967)\n         STATUS QUO  -  PICTURES OF MATCHSTICK MEN  (1968)\n         PINK FLOYD  -  SET THE CONTROLS FOR THE HEART OF THE SUN  (1968)\n         PINK FLOYD  -  CAREFUL WITH THAT AXE, EUGENE  (1968)\n         JIMI HENDRIX  -  ARE YOU EXPERIENCED   (Promo)  \n         JIMI HENDRIX  -  VOODOO CHILD  (Psychedelic Promo)\n         JEFFERSON AIRPLANE - CROWN OF CREATION (1968)\n         JEFFERSON AIRPLANE  - WE CAN BE TOGETHER (1969) - Altamont \n         JEFFERSON AIRPLANE  - THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS LIFE (1969) - Altamont \n         THE GRATEFUL DEAD  -  HARD TO HANDLE  (1970)\n         THE GRATEFUL DEAD  -  CHINA CAT  SUNFLOWER  ( I Know You Rider) (1970)\n\n\n\n\n07.06.00.  THE JIMI HENDRIX STORY \n\n        Jimi Hendrix is often considered to be the greatest electric guitarist in the history of rock music. After initial success in Europe, he achieved fame in the United States following his 1967 performance at the Monterey Pop Festival. Later, Hendrix headlined the iconic 1969 Woodstock Festival and the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. Hendrix often favored raw overdriven amplifiers with high gain and treble and helped develop the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback. Hendrix was one of the musicians who popularized the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock which he often used to deliver an exaggerated pitch in his solos, particularly with high bends and use of legato. He was influenced by blues artists such as B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Albert King, and Elmore James, rhythm and blues and soul guitarists Curtis Mayfield, Steve Cropper, as well as by funk and some modern jazz.\n       Hendrix synthesized many styles - hard rock, blues-rock, acid rock, psychedelic rock, funk rock and  blues, in creating his musical voice and his guitar style was unique.      \n       Hendrix won many of the most prestigious rock music awards in his lifetime, and has been posthumously awarded many more, including being inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Hendrix was ranked number 3 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock behind Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. Hendrix was ranked number 3 on VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of Rock N' Roll, behind the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. He has been voted by Rolling Stone, Guitar World, and a number of other magazines and polls as the best electric guitarist of all time. Guitar World's readers voted six of Hendrix's solos among the top &quot;100 Greatest&quot; of all time: &quot;Purple Haze&quot; , &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; , &quot;Machine Gun&quot; , &quot;Little Wing&quot;, &quot;Voodoo Child (Slight Return)&quot; and &quot;All Along the WatchtowerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. \n\n\n          JIMI HENDRIX  -  HEY JOE  (1967) - Beat club\n           JIMI HENDRIX  -  PURPLE HAZE   (1967) - Beat club\n           JIMI HENDRIX  -  JOHNNY B.

MAINSTREAM AND GLOBAL SUCCESS IN THE 1960s\n\n          Many acts becoming massively successful in the  UK ,United States and globally. Some of the most successful artists, such as  Peter Sarstedt, Tom Jones and  Engelbert Humperdink,  performed their own songs (and in some cases those written by others) in an eclectic variety of styles, in which the presentation of the performance itself became increasingly important.\n\n         \n         TOM JONES  -  DELILAH   (1968)\n         TOM JONES  -  GREEN GREEN GRASS OF HOME \n         ENGELBERT HUMPERDINK  -  SPANISH EYES\n         ENGELBERT HUMPERDINK  -  LES  BICYCLETTES DE BELSIZE    \n         ENGELBERT HUMPERDINK  -  PLEASE RELEASE ME \n         PETER SARSTEDT - WHERE DO YOU GO TO (My Lovely)   (1969)\n         JANE BIRKIN  &amp; SERGE  GAINSBOURG  - JE T'AIME ... moi non plus  (1969)     \n       \n\n\n 07.09.00  SOUL MUSIC \n\n          Soul music is a music genre originating in the United States combining elements of gospel music and rhythm and blues.The genre occasionally uses improvisational additions, twirls and auxiliary sounds. Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and plastic body moves, are an important feature. Other characteristics are  &quot;a call and response&quot; between the soloist and the chorus, and an especially tense vocal sound.\n          Subgenres of Soul music : Detroit soul,  Deep soul and southern soul, Memphis soul, New Orleans soul, Chicago soul, Philadelphia soul, Psychedelic soul, Country soul,  Blue-eyed soul and Brown-eyed soul \n                    \n\n\n\n07.09.01  DETROIT SOUL  (The Motown Sound) \n\n             is a style of soul music with a distinct pop influence. Among the most important architects of The Motown Sound were the members of Motown's in-house team of songwriters and record producers, including Motown founder Berry Gordy, William &quot;Smokey&quot; Robinson,Norman Whitfield &amp; Barrett Strong, and the team of Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Edward Holland, Jr., collectively known as Holland-Dozier-Holland. Also instrumental to the sound was the work of Motown's in-house band, The Funk Brothers, who performed the instrumentation on nearly every Motown hit from 1959 to 1971. From 1961 to 1971, Motown had 110 top 10 hits, and artists such as Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye,Chris Clark , Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes, The Four Tops, The Temptations ,The Jackson 5, The Velvelettes, The Spinners , The Capitols ,The Foundations , Jr. Walker &amp; the All Stars, Jimmy Ruffin ,The Miracles and Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips.\n\n\n         BEN E.KING ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ STAND BY ME  (1961)\n         THE SUPREMES  -  WHERE DID OUR LOVE GO   (1964)\n         MARTHA AND THE VANDELLAS - DANCING IN THE STREET (1965)\n         THE SUPREMES  -  YOU CAN'T HURRY LOVE   (1966)\n         MARVIN GAYE  -  TAKE THIS HEART OF MINE  (1966)\n         THE FOUR TOPS  -  REACH OUT I'll BE THERE  (1966)\n         THE FOUR TOPS  -  BABY I NEED YOUR LOVINÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢  (1965)\n         PERCY SLEDGE  - WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN   (1966)\n         THE TEMPTATION  -  MY GIRL  &amp; (I KNOW ) I'M LOSING YOU   (1967)\n         THE TEMPTATION  &amp; THE SUPREMES  - (I KNOW ) I'M LOSING YOU  (1967)\n\n\n\n07.09.02  SOUTHERN SOUL \n\n           Southern soul is a type of soul music that emerged from the Southern United States and originated from a combination of styles, including blues, country and western, early rock and roll, and a strong gospel influence. The focus of the music was not on its lyrics, but on the &quot;feel&quot; or the groove. This rhythmic force made it a strong influence in the rise of funk music. It has also been tagged deep soul or even country soul. Southern soul is often identified with artists like Professor Longhair, Allen Toussaint, Lee Dorsey, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Joe Tex, James Brown, Isaac Hayes, Carla Thomas, The Staple Singers, Sam and Dave and many others.\n         Memphis soul is stylish, funky, uptown soul music that is not as hard edged as Southern soul. The Memphis soul sound was similar to the related Motown Sound from Detroit Michigan. After the rise of disco in the late 1970s, Memphis soul declined somewhat in popularity.\nStax Records, founded in 1957, was a major factor in the creation of the Southern soul and Memphis soul music styles. \n\n\n        JAMES BROWN  -  IT'S A MAN'S MAN'S WORLD (1966)\n        ISAAC HAYES  -  WALK ON BY   (1969)\n        SAM AND DAVE  -  I  THANK YOU  (1969)\n        THE EMOTIONS  -  PEACE BE STILL  (1971)\n        THE STAPLE SINGERS  -  RESPECT YOURSELF  (1971) \n        THE STAPLE SINGERS  -  WE THE PEOPLE   (1972)\n        THE BAR KAYS   -  SON OF SHAFT   (1972)\n        JOHNNIE TAYLOR  -  JODYÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S GOT YOUR GIRL AND GONE  (1972)\n        ISAAC HAYES  -  THEME FROM SHAFT  (1972)\n        JAMES BROWN  -   PAYBACK  (1983)\n        JAMES BROWN  -  GEORGIA ON MY MIND   (1983)\n        JAMES BROWN  -  IT'S A MAN'S MAN'S WORLD (1983)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07.09.03  PSYHODELIC SOUL  \n\n            is a concept used to categorize music that features elements of psychedelic rock and soul/funk music. This kind of music thrived during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nPsychedelic soul is often connected to artists such as Sly &amp; the Family Stone and Funkadelic. Others, most notably The Temptations and their producer Norman Whitfield, War, The Undisputed Truth, and The 5th Dimension,followed the path laid out by the work of Sly Stone and his band. Psychedelic soul led the way for a harder, less subdued sound to permeate through black music, leading the way for the mainstream funk music of the early 1970s and later, disco.\n\n\n         THE 5th DIMENSION   -  AQUARIUS &amp; LET THE SUN SHINE IN  (1969)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08. THE SEVENTIES  (the decade of 1970-1979)\n  \n             One of the first events of the 70s was the break up of the Beatles in 1970. However, the seventies were also when many legendary rock bands started, or hit their peak, including Queen, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Lynyrd Skynyrd, AC/DC, Fleetwood Mac, Status Quo, Free, Aerosmith, the Eagles, Black Sabbath, Kiss, Heart, The Who, The Doors, Uriah Heep, and Van Halen, to name a few. The first half of the 1970s saw many jazz musicians from the Miles Davis school achieve cross-over success through jazz-rock fusion. Art rock, progressive rock and  glam rock were also popular. One of the most successful European groups of the decade was the quartet ABBA. The Swedish group, first found fame when they won the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest. To many people, the Seventies will be most remembered for the rise in disco music.The mid-seventies saw t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:647325f415106b6cfcc9ad602a8c64bbd65afa87","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"647325f415106b6cfcc9ad602a8c64bbd65afa87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,115,37,244,21,16,107,108,252,201,173,96,42,140,100,187,214,90,250,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
