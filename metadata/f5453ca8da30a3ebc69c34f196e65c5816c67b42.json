They are known to be an otai band (where the term otai refers to old-timers or pioneers) of thrash metal music.\n\nTheir song structures are characterised by very simple riffs and minimalist drumming overlaid with complex guitar solos.\n\nHistory\n-------\nSam, Karl, Miji and Din were Malaysian students studying at the University of Wollongong, in Australia, where they decided to form a thrash metal band. While in Australia (as a three piece band), Cromok went on to achieve a steady following and a large fanbase[citation needed], and eventually returned to Malaysia. Din died becouse of Denggi Fever in 1996, but the band continued as a trio.\n\nIn 2005, Sam announced that they were going on hiatus and that all band activities are suspended. Lead guitarist Hillary Ang rejoined his old band, Search, thus adding to the speculation of a break-up (and the end of Cromok).\n\nStyle\n-----\nThe group sings in English. They are also known to have at least one instrumental track in every album. Sam uses a teutonic thrash vocal style, while the band\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s music sounds similar to the Bay Area thrash metal.\n\nCromok also often experiments with Malay cultural music elements and sounds, adding Malay elements to their artwork.\n\nAlbum:Image Of Purity\nYears:1991\nCountry:Malaysia\nGenre:Thrash Metal\nValentine Sound Production\n\n-Track List-\n\n1.
