At 38:36 there is a clip which is played again for about half a second and then again 1:20:31 for a split second. This does not ruin the film at all and i have warned you.\n\nYou may also notice that on imdb it says the runtime is 113mins where as this release is 108mins, i believe this is due to the fact of the fps as i have watched the whole release and it seems to be all there to me.\n\nAnother note, as i had just just finished uploading, the AR seems a little off maybe, not by much though and still very watchable(I may do a v2). I recieved this as 3 files(avi split up) and as you can tell it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not great, but the best i could do with what i was given. There was a watermark in the top right hand corner belonging to madman(if anything, it shows its legit and the full thing), and the top bit of it was cropped with black bars and the rest blurred. Also as you may know, this has been sent off as an oscar screener already, but my friend has had this before they were sent off... so this is not an oscar screener if anyone was doubting the watermark....\n\nI\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d suggest playing this in vlc as it seemed a lil laggy on mpc(may just be me though),\n\nsample included, watch before you comment...\n\nENJOY this fantastic film\n\n::::::::::::::Hats Off To::::::::::::::\n\nIMAGiNE,FLAWL3SS,MTV,Tranz,Vik,Condor,everyone on that special tracker\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;And to all of you who support us, Thank you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\n\nWhy Complain?
