This is a show with a lightness of touch and yet it also encompasses the absurdity of modern dentistry, explores the curious world of parenting, celebrates the punk aesthetic and depicts a unique vision of the spirit world.\n\n\n\n\nRelease: 26/08/2010\n\n\n\n\nEncoded &amp; Uploaded By SkYnEtCeNtRaL \nFor \nLegend.killer.RG\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0f60b4498682c6d6dc8ebe389a470a549c2a0bd","amp;dn":"Spirited.S01E01.WS.DSR.XviD-LKRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0f60b4498682c6d6dc8ebe389a470a549c2a0bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,246,11,68,152,104,44,109,109,200,235,227,137,164,112,165,73,194,160,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
