Like 2003ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Echo of Hooves, the album almost entirely focuses on the traditional rather than the contemporary. This means stressing the folk aspect of her work over art songs, although when the playing and singing bite as deeply as if often does here, such distinctions become irrelevant. If TaborÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice tends towards the autumnal and the tragic, then the sparse backgrounds here are relieved by Andy CuttingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s accordion, particularly on tracks such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe DancingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Auld BeggarmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCe Fu en MaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\n\nThe albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s title suggests a thematic scheme like 2001ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Roses, but is less literal and more suggestive. It moves from love to war, contrasting betrayal and steadfastness but emphasizing remembrance (perhaps the titleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clearest attributable meaning). The collection includes classic Scottish love songs (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Rigs of RyeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) century- old English and American ballads (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Old Garden GateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Love My LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), and others that date back hundreds of years, including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAu Logis De Mon PereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a descendant of the 11th-century ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAu Pommier DouxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, that sees three girls asleep under an apple tree, mistaking the light of battle for the light of dawn. It is a measure of this albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s beauty of execution that these traditional songs sit perfectly next to contemporary numbers such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStanding in LineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, perhaps this albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most powerful evocation of the effects of war, and one not dissimilar from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Band Played Waltzing MatildaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which Tabor covered on her 1976 debut Airs and Graces.\n\n\nIt would be unhelpful to describe this as TaborÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“bestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ album to date when she has already set such high standards, but it certainly passes muster; TaborÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice is superb throughout (never more so than on Hector MacMillanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s arrangement of Robbie BurnsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSpeakeasyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), delving deeply into tradition to reveal the art that was always there. Yes, we do like these apples. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a314ff316f46dd5ea354d6b88f8705d0be8a3f35","amp;dn":"June+Tabor...Apples%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a314ff316f46dd5ea354d6b88f8705d0be8a3f35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,20,255,49,111,70,221,94,163,84,214,184,143,135,5,208,190,138,63,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
