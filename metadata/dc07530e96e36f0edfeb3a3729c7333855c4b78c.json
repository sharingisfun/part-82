Johnson, businessman, triathlete, and libertarian politician who served as the 29th Governor of the U.S. state of New Mexico from 1995 to 2003. Johnson is the chairman of a political advocacy organization, the Our America Initiative. He believes that the Constitution should be interpreted according to its original meaning and that a proper balance needs to be restored between the different branches of government. He supports the rights of states. Johnson has also been the subject of media speculation as a possible candidate for President in the 2012 election.\n[hour 3]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_E._Johnson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_E._Johnson&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dailypaul.com/node/50621&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dailypaul.com/node/50621&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ouramericainitiative.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ouramericainitiative.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.johnsonforamerica.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.johnsonforamerica.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n[Ted Anderson is live in studio for about 12 minutes in the middle of hour 1 promoting his gold business, Midas Resources.]\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
