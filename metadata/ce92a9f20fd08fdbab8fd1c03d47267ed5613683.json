Wolfpac released its debut extended play, Somethin Wicked This Way Comes, on May 18, 1999 through Chord Recordings. Daddy Long Legs claims that he funded the EP's production by robbing graves and selling the bones to occult stores. Wolfpac expanded its cult following through appearances on The Howard Stern Show and Opie and Anthony, and released its debut album, Evil Is... on January 16, 2001 on Megaforce Records.\n\nThe group's musical style fuses hip hop beats with hardcore and metal samples. Its lyrical style draws from horrorcore, focusing on subjects such as resurrection, revenge, necrophilia, and standing up for one's own beliefs. The group's live performances from time to time include a DJ, guitar player and strippers.\n\nContents @ 128kbps\n-----------------\n1999 - Somethin Wicked This Way Comes\n2001 - Evil Is...\n2007 - From the Vault\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf I could get some better quality rips, I would be more than likely to change the files. Also, if you got any of their other releases, I would be more than happy to include them.
