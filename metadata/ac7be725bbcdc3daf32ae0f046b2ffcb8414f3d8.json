My Memory?\nThursday October 28 at 9 pm ET on CBC-TV\n\nSynopsis\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that moment we all dread: we meet someone we know, but suddenly canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t recall his name. Or we forget where we put our purse, our wallet, our keys.  Sometimes we canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t remember the word for the uh ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ cÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢mon, you know, the uh, thing-a-ma-jig to wash the salad. And by the way, where exactly did we park the car?\n\nMemory loss is the second greatest health fear for Canadians, after cancer. And memory loss is a growing epidemic, as we live longer, our brains age, and we have more and more information to forget. Throw in the information overload from new technologies. The result: T.M.I.

Or are there ways to keep our memories - and even make them better? If you can lose your memory, can you find it?\n\nTo find answers to these big questions, Where Did I Put...My Memory? takes viewers on an unforgettable journey around the world\n\nFile Information\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 419 MiB for 44mn 6s 552ms\nSource            : CBC HD\nCodec             : XviD\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 186 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 352 (1.773) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 129 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac7be725bbcdc3daf32ae0f046b2ffcb8414f3d8","amp;dn":"Doc+Zone.Where+Did+I+Put+My+Memory.28.Oct.2010.HDTV.XviD-Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac7be725bbcdc3daf32ae0f046b2ffcb8414f3d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,123,231,37,187,205,195,218,243,42,224,240,70,178,255,203,132,20,243,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
