Many of its inhabitants are the hardened descendants of French refugees who were forced out of Canada in the 18th century and settled in this harsh yet majestic environment. Today, these people are known as the Cajuns, a group renowned throughout the world for their flavorful cuisine, distinctive music and vibrant culture. Resilient, self-reliant and fiercely independent, the Cajuns of the Atchafalaya Swamp still carry on many of their ancestors' trades and traditions.\n\nHISTORY follows these swampers through a time of year that is crucial to their survival: the 30-day alligator hunting season. At its core, this is a uniquely American story of a proud and skillful people fighting to maintain an ancient way of life in a rapidly modernizing world, despite the many perils and trials that stand in their way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88b2faa243d4716a8d5b8ba494af9e4ea91038ff","amp;dn":"swamp.people.s01e08.gator.voodoo.hdtv.xvid-momentum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88b2faa243d4716a8d5b8ba494af9e4ea91038ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,178,250,162,67,212,113,106,141,91,139,164,148,175,158,78,169,16,56,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
