Unbeknownst to them, they've chosen the worst night on Earth to visit, as every sixty-six years, the long-dead bodies of Templar Knights buried there have the chance to wake and feast upon the living...\n\nReview\n\nDo you enjoy watching really bad movies?\n\nIf you don't, run as fast as you can.\n\nIf you do, don't miss this one. It's simply ridiculous, from start to finish. Mind-bogglingly bad dialogs, a completely wacky story, pointless nudity, charmingly fake-looking gore and Templar and Nazi zombies. What more could you possibly want?\n\nI was thoroughly entertained throughout the whole movie. The characters can't make up their minds about anything, switching positions back and forth basically from scene to scene and sometimes even in the middle of a dialog... just as the wine bottles here seem unable to decide whether they're full or empty, etc etc.\n\nActually, there's not much more to say about this one. As I said: If you enjoy watching a really bad movie every now and then, just watch this.\n\nI couldn't find a trailer!!!\n\nSCREENS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img522.imageshack.us/img522/2695/vlcsnap2010110113h40m04.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img522.imageshack.us/img522/2695/vlcsnap2010110113h40m04.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/200/vlcsnap2010110113h40m43.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/200/vlcsnap2010110113h40m43.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img180.imageshack.us/img180/613/vlcsnap2010110113h42m48.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img180.imageshack.us/img180/613/vlcsnap2010110113h42m48.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img179.imageshack.us/img179/3213/vlcsnap2010110113h43m02.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img179.imageshack.us/img179/3213/vlcsnap2010110113h43m02.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/4006/vlcsnap2010110113h44m01.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/4006/vlcsnap2010110113h44m01.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSEED AND ENJOY FOLKS!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0c141cdf53beeb18d265e2c5b4274088513c200","amp;dn":"Dont+Wake+the+Dead+2008+-+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0c141cdf53beeb18d265e2c5b4274088513c200","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,193,65,205,245,59,238,177,141,38,94,44,91,66,116,8,133,19,194,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
