The personnel also included Peter Thorup, vocals; Alan Parker, guitar; Harold\nMcNair, flute; Herbie Flowers, bass; Roger Coulam, keyboards; Barry Morgan, drums;\nplus Don Lusher and Bill Geldard, trombone. Some of the musicians were also members\nof Blue Mink.\n\n\nReview by Dave Thompson @ allmusic\n\nIt seems strange to see the output of Mickie Most's RAK label finally being taken\nseriously by record labels as well as collectors, 30-plus years after the imprint established\nitself as the epitome of disposable pop tunes. Yet EMI's ongoing As, Bs &amp; Rarities series\noffers nothing less than the same thorough treatment that any other, more hallowed, label\ncould expect. The format is essentially the same throughout: a gathering up of every RAK\nsingle (A-sides and B-sides) released by a given band, with the remainder of the CD filled\nwith choice outtakes and oddities -- which, in CCS' case, covers a lot of territories. From\nthe band's opening shot (and hit), a spectral cover of Led Zeppelin's &quot;Whole Lotta Love,&quot;\nand on through such off-kilter delights as &quot;Brother,&quot; &quot;Walking,&quot; and the quite salacious\n&quot;Tap Turns On the Water,&quot; CCS maintained a dignified but often unsettling role in the\nU.K. charts of the early '70s. Neither did the magic cease when the records stopped\nselling -- their first-ever flop, 1972's &quot;16 Tons,&quot; offers up a near-definitive rendition of that\njolly old chestbeater. Seven straight singles plug the bulk of this collection, with the Bsides\n(a superlative rendition of John Lee Hooker's &quot;Boom Boom&quot; among them)\nfrequently sounding as great as the hits. From there, five tracks highlight CCS' three\noriginal albums, before two superlative, and previously unissued, outtakes close the set.\nThe sleeve notes make the point that, of all the music that main man Alexis Korner made\nthroughout his career, CCS is frequently overlooked by the repackagers. This collection\ngoes a long way toward remedying that oversight and might, if listeners are really lucky,\neven lead to reissues for the original LPs themselves.\n\n\n\n\n  01.
