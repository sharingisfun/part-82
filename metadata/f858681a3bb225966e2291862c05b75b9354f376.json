At her engagement party, she escapes the crowd to consider whether to go through with the marriage and falls down a hole in the garden after spotting an unusual rabbit. Arriving in a strange and surreal place called &quot;Underland,&quot; she finds herself in a world that resembles the nightmares she had as a child, filled with talking animals, villainous queens and knights, and frumious bandersnatches. Alice realizes that she is there for a reason--to conquer the horrific Jabberwocky and restore the rightful queen to her throne.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f858681a3bb225966e2291862c05b75b9354f376","amp;dn":"Alice+In+Wonderland+2010+TS+XViD+-+IMAGiNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f858681a3bb225966e2291862c05b75b9354f376","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,88,104,26,59,178,37,150,110,34,145,134,44,5,183,91,147,84,243,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
