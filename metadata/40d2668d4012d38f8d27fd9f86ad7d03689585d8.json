Some content was lost. Note that picture freeze before the first commercial break sticks but you can still listen to the commentary.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE: To get updates from me on the capturing, editing, and compression process of the torrents, you can get more information by visiting a Twitter page I created atI created this so that you will all have a good idea on when to expect the torrents in the coming weeks.\n\nTORRENT NOTE: This video has been edited with no commercials and covers the entire race live, no highlights. Part 1, Part 2, &amp; Part 3 are separate files so that you can download Part 1 first to watch the race while you are downloading Part 2 &amp; 3.
