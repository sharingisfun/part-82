It is a simple,\nbut quite effective on-demand scanner. The program does not use false positives. Our tests\nrevealed that ScanSpyware is able to correctly identify and eliminate common spyware and\nadware infections.\n\nThe application checks the Windows registry, running processes, web browser cookies, local\nfiles and folders. It allows running two system scan types - Quick Scan and Complete Scan.\nThe first one is the most effective. It usually takes 7-8 minutes to complete. Quick Scan\nis a bit faster, but less thorough. ScanSpyware can also check separate user-defined disks\nand directories. However, such custom scans usually take a long time. The program uses large\nspyware definitions database updated on a regular basis. ScanSpyware does not have any additional\ntools. Its only functions are scanning, Backup/Restore and Ignore List.\n\nThe program's interface is simple and user-friendly. However, it could be more convenient.\n\nThe free version refuses to remove any malware it finds and asks to register and purchase the\nfull product.\n\nThe official web site is www.scanspyware.net. Orders are made via reputable services using secure\nconnection.\n\nIn the middle of 2004, ScanSpyware's previous version was added to several corrupt anti-spyware\nlists because of false positives and aggressive advertising. However, the situation has changed.\nRecent ScanSpyware versions do not produce false positives, and the official web site does not\nserve unsolicited advertisements anymore.\n\nnote:::crack the program &amp; then update(or use-ssdb091210 file in update folder).copy &quot;ssdb091210&quot; file in update folder &amp; paste in c-drive program files &quot;ScanSpyware v3.8.0.2&quot; then run the ScanSpyware.now u r secure...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe987f65dc62763a764a665eecb79fca1d5d50bb","amp;dn":"ScanSpyware+3.8.0.2with+update%28full%29.aaaevilacharya","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe987f65dc62763a764a665eecb79fca1d5d50bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,152,127,101,220,98,118,58,118,74,102,94,236,183,159,202,29,93,80,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
