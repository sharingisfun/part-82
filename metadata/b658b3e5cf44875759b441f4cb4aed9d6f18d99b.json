In other words, the instrumental backing may be acoustic, but the lyrics are as caustic as they are confessional. Three tracks, &quot;State of the Union,&quot; &quot;Katie,&quot; and &quot;Cheer Up (You Miserable F**k),&quot; can't even be played on the radio--in their unedited form, at any rate. Released to wide acclaim in the UK in 2005, Ford wrote, performed, and produced I Sincerely Apologize for All the Trouble I've Caused. He even shot the videos. Granted, there are a few guests: Franco Bidanco (saxophone), Frances Law, and Ford's football club, Team Sundry (backing vocals). The rest is all David, who has a way with self-deprecation and a soothing voice that reveals a trace of a Sussex accent. In &quot;I Don't Care What You Call Me,&quot; he laments, &quot;I am unforgivable.&quot; On &quot;Katie,&quot; it's &quot;I'm so dumb.&quot; He has choice words for old lovers, too, like &quot;I know I let you down/and Christ, you let me know/every time/and time again&quot; (&quot;I Don't Care&quot;). The results lie between fellow Brits Badly Drawn Boy and label mate Aqualung, with whom he has shared the stage. I Sincerely Apologize may not exactly be a day brightener, but it's a cathartic listen for anyone who's ever wronged or been wronged--and who hasn't been on one side or another of that equation? --Kathleen C.
