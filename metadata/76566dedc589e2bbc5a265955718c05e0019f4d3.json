The song's vocals are lip-synced in the video by bassist Tim Nordwind  instead of Damian, following the format from the dance choreographed for the song &quot;C-C-C-Cinnamon Lips&quot;, which Tim sings. The footage was not intended to be released as the single's music video, but it was sent via e-mail to friends of the band and spread around the internet becoming an internet sensation. It premiered on Fuse on August 18, 2005.\n\nOn July 18, 2006, OK Go unveiled &quot;The OK Go Dances With You(tube) Contest&quot; in which contestants submitted their pastiches of the video onThe winners would dance live with the band at one of their concerts. The contest ended on August 31, 2006. A compilation of these submissions was added on the DVD for the Deluxe Edition of Oh No.\n\nThe routine has been performed by the band on many occasions. They performed it on Mad TV and Soccer AM. They also performed the number in Paris, France to promote their French website.\n\nOh No is the second studio album by Chicago rock band OK Go. It was released 30 August 2005. The album was recorded in late 2004 with producer Tore Johansson in MalmÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶, Sweden. It is the final album to feature guitarist Andy Duncan, who left shortly after recording finished.\n\nAs of January 12, 2007, the album has sold 198,045 units.\n\nAfter the band's performance at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, their album moved up to #2 on the iTunes Music Store album sales charts (as of September 3, 2006). Their album sold 8,250 units in the following week, a 95% increase over the prior week, rocketing from #87 to #69 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, the highest position ever achieved by any OK Go album until the release of &quot;Of the Blue Colour of the Sky&quot; five years later.\n\nOn November 7, 2006, OK Go released a deluxe limited edition CD/DVD of the album.
