In \n\nfact, a horribly under rated disc.\n\nThese tracks were recorded years after the CD came out as Lieif Edling wanted to release this material on double vinyl. The \n\ntrouble was, he didn't have enough material for a double disc and the record companies refused to press it.\n\nSo, he gets in touch with Bjorn Floodquist (vocals), Jejo Perkovic (drums), and Mats Stahl and his wicked Gibson SG and they \n\nbang out these three tracks, thus fulfilling the time requirements for a 2 LP set.\n\n1.
