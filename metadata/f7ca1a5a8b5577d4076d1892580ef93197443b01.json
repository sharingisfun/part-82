Like many, I was underwhelmed by Sensuous, but by adding a few b-sides released at the time into the playlist, switching up the running order, and getting rid of some of the tracks that sucked, a mature and conceptually focused album has emerged. \n\nPlaylist:\n\nBetter Sensuous\nBreezin'\nEyes\nFit Song\nClap&amp;Whistle&amp;Walking\nMusic (Japanese Version by Petra Haden)\nToner\nOmstart\nBeep It\nLike A Rolling Stone\nMusic \nSleep Warm \n\nI listen to this album a heck of a lot, and I listened to 'Sensuous' almost never, so I think this has been a big success. Enjoy and seed.
