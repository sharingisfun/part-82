This quartet was very famous during the period 1930-1960. See also information in WIKIPEDIA. Not of all the songs have a good sound quality. Some songs I recorded it from AFN Bremerhafen on the mediumwave years ago. \n\nSo I hope you will enjoy these songs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f76bbaac9541a0281762e627e1052f3e0e74276","amp;dn":"The+Harmonizing+Four+-+My+favourite+gospelgroup+%5BKu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f76bbaac9541a0281762e627e1052f3e0e74276","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,118,187,170,201,84,26,2,129,118,46,98,126,16,82,243,224,231,66,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
