This also includes IE8 and slipstreamed\nWMP11 with all hotfixes.\n\n- Slimmed XP\nSame as above with WMP11 slipstreamed, but this has a few items\nremoved, the only item that might be needed is Chinese, Japanese\nand Korean. The only other items removed are redundant items like\nthe Windows XP &quot;Tour&quot;.\n\n- TinyXP\nThis aims to remove only the big components in Windows. Its smaller\nsize comes not from taking out items, but by simply not updating\nto IE8 or WMP11 and instead, updating the OS the same way to June\n2010 but with IE6 and WMP9 like the original XP. You will only see\none Windows Update appear for this on Windows Update - &quot;Internet\nExplorer 8&quot;\n\n- MicroXP\nThis is, as usual, stripped right down to the bare OS almost.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Server 2003 versions are the same as above in terms of removed\ncomponents, for example, Tiny2003 has the same items removed as\nTinyXP.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nAll installations are &quot;typical&quot; installations in that you can access\nthe Repair Option or Recovery Console - even the MicroXP and Micro2003\nversions are NOT unattended. This allows you to choose your keyboard\nand timezone etc as Windows installs. If you don't like this and want\nan unattended installation, no problem, just look in the ISO folder\non the DVD and there you have 32 options for making a CD sized ISO file.\n\nDrivers are automatically included with all eight installations.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nTo install Windows from this DVD, set your PC up so it will boot from\nthe CD/DVD-ROM in the PC's BIOS.\n\nYou do not need any product key for any of the installations.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nDRIVERS\n\nYou have the following drivers in all 8 options:\n\n- Chipset --------&gt; (included by default)\n- CPU ------------&gt; (included by default)\n- Graphics -------&gt; (included by default)\n- LAN Ethernet ---&gt; (included by default)\n- SATA -----------&gt; (included by default)\n- Sound ----------&gt; (included by default)\n- Wireless LAN ---&gt; (included by default)\n\nWhen the PC reboots for the first time during installation (just after\nWindows files have copied) then you will see a driver selector pop up.\n\nIf you do not catch this in time, or are not sat at the PC when this\ndriver selector has timed out (after one minute) then all the drivers\nwill extract - bear in mind, this will take a few gigabytes of disk\nspace. If you do not want to extract the driverpacks, make sure you\nare sat at the PC after the files have copied and it reboots.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nAPPS folder\n\nSILENT INSTALLERS:\n\n7-Zip v4.65\nallSnap v1.33.2\nAutoIt v2.64\nDaemon Tools Lite v4.35\nDirectX 9c Feb 2010\nEverything v1.2.1.371\nFlash Player v10.0.45.2 (IE)\nFolderSizes v4.5.1.1\nFoxit PDF Reader Pro v3.0.1301\nGetDiz v4.4.0.2\nHashTab v3.0\nIMG Burn v2.5.0.0\nNET Framework v3.5\nNotepad2 v4.0.23\nPrio v1.9.9.2091\nUnlocker v1.8.8\nuTorrent v1.8.5.17414\nVisual C++ Runtimes 2005 2008\nVMware Workstation Lite v5.5.4 (Build 44386)\nWinRAR v3.91\n\nPORTABLE PROGRAMS:\n\nAgent Ransack v1.7.3.332\nChromePlus v1.4.0.0\nDesksave v8.2.1\nDeVeDe v3.12.2\nDir2Txt v1.0\nDuplicate File Finder v3.5\nDVDFab Platinum v6.2.1.8\nExamDiff Pro v3.1.4.8\nFoobar2000 v1.0\nGoogle Earth v5.1.3506.3999b\nG Spot Codec Viewer v2.70a\nHandBrake v0.9.4\nHex Workshop v6.0.1.4603\nLevelator v2.1.1\nNero Micro v9.4.13.2\nNicotine+ v1.2.10 With GTK+ v2.16.0\nPhotoshop v11 CS4 Lite\nPowerArchiver 2010 v11.50.41\nProcess Explorer v11.33\nResource Hacker v3.4.0.79\nShutdown Timer v1.0.3\nSMplayer v0.6.8.3392\nSoftMaker Office 2010 Rev 570\nSopCast 3.2.9 [SMplayer v0.6.9]\nSound Forge v10.0a Build 425\nStartup Control Panel v2.8\nTCP View v2.54\nUltimateDefrag 2008 v2.0.0.55\nUltraISO v9.3.5.2716\nUnstoppable Copier v2.28\nVideo MP3 Extractor v1.6.0.35\nVirtual DJ v5.2.1\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nISO folder\n\nIn the ISO folder you will see 32 batch files - these 32 files give\nyou 32 separate options for building a sub-700Mb CD ISO file of a\nchosen option.\n\nYou can choose XP or 2003, full, slimmed, Tiny or Micro but also,\nyou can choose to include drivers (or not) and even make the CD\ninstall as an &quot;Unattended&quot; CD where no user input is needed in\nthe Windows setup.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nREMOVED ITEMS\n\nYou can see what items were removed by opening the &quot;Last Session.ini&quot;\nfile that corresponds to the installation you want to check.\n\nAll nLite &quot;Last Session&quot; files can be found in the relevant folders:\n\nOption 1 = XP01I386SVCPACKNLITELast Session.ini\nOption 2 = XP02I386SVCPACKNLITELast Session.ini\nOption 3 = XP03I386SVCPACKNLITELast Session.ini\nOption 4 = XP04I386SVCPACKNLITELast Session.ini\n\nOption 5 = WS01I386SVCPACKNLITELast Session.ini\nOption 6 = WS02I386SVCPACKNLITELast Session.ini\nOption 7 = WS03I386SVCPACKNLITELast Session.ini\nOption 8 = WS04I386SVCPACKNLITELast Session.ini\n\n(If using these files, nLite version 1.4.9.1 must be used)\n\nThese files also list all the hotfixes slipstreamed with nLite.\n\nAll other Windows Updates can be found in the &quot;WU&quot; folder of\neach &quot;????I386SVCPACK&quot; (where ???? is XP01 or XP02 etc)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\neXPerience folder (Desktop)\n\nMost of these folders contain quick solutions to things that otherwise\nwould be buried away in the Windows GUI, or require DOS style commands.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nDon't forget To Join The Forum @ SnipeR's Redemption Network:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://retestrak.nl/board/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://retestrak.nl/board/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy this fine release from eXPerience\n\nRelease Date : June 2010","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3617269d3d7d82b8160c77109cac9409f91045a","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+2003+Multi-Boot+DVD+x86+June+2010+-+eXPerience+%7BThump","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3617269d3d7d82b8160c77109cac9409f91045a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,97,114,105,211,215,216,43,129,96,199,113,9,202,201,64,159,145,4,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
