Alice is a drama teacher who goes on a cultural mission to a small town where the most bizarre occurrences are commonplace. Mirrors become doors, circus animals walk the streets, and it seems anything can happen - and everyone except Alicia seems resigned to the situation. She discovers before long that the town's population is made up of officials and workers who have been fired for violating rules, minor or illusionary, and now cannot find their way out of this strange town.One of the most controversial films in the history of Cuba, ALICE IN WONDERTOWN was banned by government authorities from Cuban theatres shortly after its release, threatening the independence that the Cuban film industry hitherto had enjoyed.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img684.imageshack.us/img684/3986/wonderavisnapshot001547.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img684.imageshack.us/img684/3986/wonderavisnapshot001547.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/7360/wonderavisnapshot002343.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/7360/wonderavisnapshot002343.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/9760/wonderavisnapshot003428.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/9760/wonderavisnapshot003428.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------not my rip------------\n\n~~~~~~ Alice in Wondertown.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n\n                                                               \n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,149,733,154                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.1.2 Final              \n\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:29:16                \n\nFrame Count:....................................128399             \n\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................708                  \n\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................480                  \n\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.311                     \n\nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \n\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1514                 \n\n......MPEG-4..............................                    \n\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.186&quot;                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \n\nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \n\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \n\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \n\nAudio Channel Count:............................2      \n\n*****************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
