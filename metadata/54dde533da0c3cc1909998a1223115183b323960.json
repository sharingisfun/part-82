While national attention focused on the Great Depression and the impending war in Europe, families extended summer vacations, children began a new school year, and Katharine Hepburn returned to her family's summer home in Connecticut to nurse a failing career. All were unaware that the hurricane barreling toward them at near record speed would become one of the deadliest in U.S. history, claiming hundreds of lives.\n\nNATUREA'S FURY relives the power and terror of the storm still known as A&quot;The HurricaneA&quot; to New EnglandA's old-timers. At 500 miles wide, it wreaked destruction across great swathes of the coast, destroying entire communities, devastating fleets and literally remaking the map. Unfamiliar with hurricanes--the last truly epic storm to hit the Northeast was the great gale of 1898--the 25-million residents of the Northeast learned of their power firsthand in the most violent and destructive natural disaster in their history.\n\nFile Size ------- 698mb\nLength ---------- 1:30:04\nResolution ------ 720x432\nContainer ------- avi\nVideo Codec ----- h264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 24\n\nTracked and seeded by thehashden.com\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54dde533da0c3cc1909998a1223115183b323960","amp;dn":"National+Geographic%3A+Nature%5C%27s+Fury+-+New+England+Hurricane","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54dde533da0c3cc1909998a1223115183b323960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,221,229,51,218,12,60,193,144,153,152,161,34,49,21,24,59,50,57,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
