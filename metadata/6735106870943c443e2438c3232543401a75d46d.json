Explaining the next shot of looking her up and down.\nThe movie is the director's cut and so the original ending is included not the one with the supermarket,and this version is 96 minutes long.I did notice that the Anchor Bay versions look cropped on all four sides in some scenes and even zoomed in others,where the picture quality on this looks far superior.\n\nThe MGM version also includes possibly the best 5.1 mix created for this film as well.Enjoy guys!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6735106870943c443e2438c3232543401a75d46d","amp;dn":"Evil+Dead+3%3AArmy+of+Darkness+SE+Directors+Cut+Full+ISO+by+LKRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6735106870943c443e2438c3232543401a75d46d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,53,16,104,112,148,60,68,62,36,56,195,35,37,67,64,26,117,212,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
