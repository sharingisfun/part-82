Road users pass them every day - sudden flashes of \n       flowers tied to lampposts or lying by the side of the road. Across \n       the UK roadside memorials have become the expected response when \n       someone dies suddenly in a traffic collision. For friends and \n       family the spot where these tributes are left becomes sacred; for \n       others these shrines are an eyesore and a display that should be \n       kept private. Yet behind each roadside memorial there is a story \n       of personal grief.\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n           * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs\n           * winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n           * dont forget to tag your work\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d690b9a4b5b396bea3a5bef8b7bf&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0ae0ca96fce5721a0d8876a96db5a0a11c827f7","amp;dn":"In.Loving.Memory.2010.DOCU.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0ae0ca96fce5721a0d8876a96db5a0a11c827f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,174,12,169,111,206,87,33,160,216,135,106,150,219,90,10,17,200,39,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
