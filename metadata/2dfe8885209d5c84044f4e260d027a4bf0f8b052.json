With advances in navigation, engineering, and meteorology, people today have learned to avoid some of these catastrophes. But our sophisticated technologies have also created new threats, and the possibility that our own actions are making the oceans deadlier.\n\nFile Size ------- 698mb\nLength ---------- 1:30:31\nResolution ------ 720x480\nContainer ------- mkv\nVideo Codec ----- x264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 24\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k\nThanks to (anonymous) for the generous seedbox donation.\nAlso Supported by \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://magnet-dev.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://magnet-dev.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dfe8885209d5c84044f4e260d027a4bf0f8b052","amp;dn":"History+Channel%3A+Underwater+Universe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dfe8885209d5c84044f4e260d027a4bf0f8b052","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,254,136,133,32,157,92,132,4,79,78,38,13,2,122,75,240,248,176,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
