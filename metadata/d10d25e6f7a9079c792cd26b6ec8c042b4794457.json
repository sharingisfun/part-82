Billing themselves as &quot;New Zealand's fourth most popular guitar-based digi-bongo a cappella-rap-funk-comedy folk duo&quot;, the group depends upon a combination of witty banter and acoustic guitars to work the audience.\n\n\nIn 2002 they performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival for the first time. Returning in 2003 with a new show, they were nominated for the prestigious Perrier Award. They also performed there in 2004.\n\nIn 2005, BBC Radio 2 broadcast their first radio series. Largely improvised, it features Rob Brydon as their narrator, Rhys Darby as their manager and Jimmy Carr as a devoted fan called Kipper. \n\n\n\nThe Flight Of The Conchords - S01 - E01\nThe Flight Of The Conchords - S01 - E02\nThe Flight Of The Conchords - S01 - E03\nThe Flight Of The Conchords - S01 - E04\nThe Flight Of The Conchords - S01 - E05\nThe Flight Of The Conchords - S01 - E06\n\n.\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d10d25e6f7a9079c792cd26b6ec8c042b4794457","amp;dn":"The+Flight+Of+The+Conchords+-+S01+-+Radio+Series+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d10d25e6f7a9079c792cd26b6ec8c042b4794457","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,13,37,230,247,169,7,156,121,44,210,107,110,200,192,66,180,121,68,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
