His driving vision was to capture fragments of actuality which, when organized together, showed a deeper truth which could not be seen with the naked eye. In the \\\\\\&quot;Kino-Pravda\\\\\\&quot; series, Vertov focused on everyday experiences, eschewing bourgeois concerns and filming marketplaces, bars, and schools instead, sometimes with a hidden camera, without asking permission first.\n\n\nCountry landscape, local post-office, people pick up packages.
