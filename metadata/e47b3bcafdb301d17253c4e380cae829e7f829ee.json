Almost two hours of new \n\nmusic composed and recorded over an intense ten week period last \n\nfall, Ghosts I - IV sprawls Nine Inch Nails across a variety of new \n\nterrain.\n\nTrent Reznor explains, &quot;I've been considering and wanting to make \n\nthis kind of record for years, but by its very nature it wouldn't \n\nhave made sense until this point. This collection of music is the \n\nresult of working from a very visual perspective - dressing imagined \n\nlocations and scenarios with sound and texture; a soundtrack for \n\ndaydreams. I'm very pleased with the result and the ability to \n\npresent it directly to you without interference.
