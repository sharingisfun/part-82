Explore the mysterious Amazon through the amazing IMAX (R) experience and celebrate the beauty, vitality and wonder of this magical rain forest, which is disappearing at an alarming rate. Filmmakers overcame many difficulties to photograph this rarely seen tropical landscape and present it with all the visual power associated with IMAX. Narrated by Academy Award-winning actress Linda Hunt, this unique collaboration between an American scientist and a tribal shaman on a mission to find rare medicinal plants will amaze and astound you. \n\nThe combination of the traditional orchestra along with ethnic woodwinds, percussion and choir, created a musical tapestry as rich as the rainforest itself. \n\nAs a composer, Alan Williams has scored films in many genres ranging from the epic IMAX film AMAZON to action/adventure pictures like CLUBHOUSE DETECTIVES, ANGELS IN THE ATTIC and CHRONOS 5.O. He also has scored dramatic films like CADILLAC and THE AFFAIR as well as a number of thrillers including ASYLUM. Williams proves his range and versatility as he has written both songs and underscore for the animated features THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA and TINY HEROES. Among his television credits is the music for the TV series HIGH TIDE.
