At the center of Deception are two adulterers in \ntheir hiding place. He is a middle-aged American writer named Philip, living in \nLondon, and she is an articulate, intelligent, well-educated Englishwoman \ncompromised by a humiliating marriage to which, in her thirties, she is already \nnervously half-resigned. The action consists of conversation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ mainly the \nlovers talking to each other before and after making love. That dialogue ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nsharp, rich, playful, inquiring, &quot;moving,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as Hermione Lee writes, &quot;on a scale \nof pain from furious bafflement to stoic gaiety&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is nearly all there is to \nthis audiobook, and all there needs to be. \n\n&quot;A fiendishly clever piece of work... an amazing feat... HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s invented the \npurest speech, the most convincing cadences, of any American novelist.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nWilliam Pritchard, Hudson Review   \n\n - - -\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nDeception is a 1990 novel by Philip Roth. This book marks the first time Roth \nuses his own name as the name of the main protagonist within a fictional work \n(he had previously used himself as a main character in a work of non-fiction - \nThe Facts: A Novelist's Autobiography). At the center of the book are \nconversations between a married American named Philip, living in London, and a \nmarried EnglishwomanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½trapped with a little child in a loveless \nupper-middle-class household. The lives of both characters are gradually \nrevealed as they talk before and after making love.\n\n\nPhilip Roth titles in the FPL:\n\n -Goodbye, Columbus +5\t(1959)\t5 readers\n -Letting Go  \t\t(1962)\tLuke Daniels\n -When She Was Good \t(1967)\tTanya Eby\n -The Breast\t\t(1972)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Great American Novel(1973)James Daniels\n -My Life as a Man\t(1974)\tDan John Miller\n -The Professor of Desire(1977)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Ghost Writer \t(1979)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Zuckerman unbound\t(1981)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Anatomy Lesson \t(1983)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Counterlife\t(1986)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Facts: Autobio\t(1988)\tMel Foster\n&gt;&gt;Deception \t\t(1990)\tD Colacci &amp; S Ericken\n -Patrimony\t\t(1991)\tGeorge Guidall\n -American Pastoral\t(1997)\tRon Silver\n -I Married a Communist\t(1998)\tRon Silver\n -The Dying Animal\t(2001)\tTom Stechschulte\n -The Plot Against America(2004)Ron Silver\n -Everyman\t\t(2006)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Exit Ghost\t\t(2007)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Indignation\t\t(2008)\tDick Hill\n -The Humbling\t\t(2009)\tDick Hill\n -Nemesis\t\t(2010)\tDennis Boutsikaris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa74aab72f3d751a8ff4b1a7af87591116d57707","amp;dn":"DECEPTION+-+Philip+Roth.+Read+by+Colacci-Ericken+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa74aab72f3d751a8ff4b1a7af87591116d57707","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,116,170,183,47,61,117,26,143,244,177,167,175,135,89,17,22,213,119,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
