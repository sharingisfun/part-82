THE FIFTIES\n\n\n           The 1950s offered a combination of sounds for everyone. Rock 'n roll, rhythm and blues, love songs, jazz (first Newport Festival), calypso (Harry Belafonte), and musicals were all popular. Records rather than air play began to determine the popularity of a song.  Hit makers were Johnny Ray, Patti Page, Nat King Cole, Teresa Brewer,Tony Bennett, Perry Como,  Pat Boone, Doris Day, Eddie Fisher, Frankie Laine, Dean Martin , and Peggy Lee. Groups were popular, including the Platters, Les Paul and Mary Ford, Ames Brothers , Four Aces, Buddy Holly and many others made the huge number of decade hits.In 1956, Elvis became the first rock star. Black recording artists Chuck Berry and Fats Domino became rock 'n roll stars. Color TV became a major influence, stereos were offered for sale, the first Grammy (1959) was given.  \n\n\n06.01. &quot;FEEL GOODÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ TUNES OF THE FIFTIES AND EARLY SIXTIES \n\n   \n        Light melodies, sweet lyrics, wholesome singers.

ROCK AND ROLL &amp; ROCKABILLY \n\n           In Chicago, two brothers, Phil and Leonard Chess  took the best of the black bluesmen performing in their nightclub and began recording them on their Chess label. Chess Records, a storefront on Cottage Avenue in the &quot;Little Mississippi&quot; area of Chicago, was already home to the great Muddy Waters. About this time, a Cleveland DJ named Alan Freed  began playing Black R&amp;B tunes. Freed moved his show to New York in 1954 and began including live performances, especially of the artists with the vocal harmonies he favored. His called this sound Rock and Roll. Fittingly, he is the first Rock DJ. And many consider his Moondog Coronation Ball, held March 21st, 1952 in Cleveland, to be the very birthdate of Rock and Roll.\n\n          Rock and roll  is a genre of popular music that evolved in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Its roots lay mainly in blues, rhythm and blues, country, folk, gospel, and jazz. The style subsequently spread to the rest of the world and developed further, leading ultimately to modern rock music. \n\n          Rockabilly is one of the earliest styles of rock and roll music, and emerged in the early 1950s. The term rockabilly is a portmanteau of rock and hillbilly, the latter a reference to the country music (often called hillbilly music in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style's development. Other important influences on rockabilly include western swing, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues. Many  popular rock and roll singers of the time, such as Fats Domino, Chuck Berry and Little Richard, came out of the black rhythm and blues tradition, making the music attractive to white audiences, and are not usually classed as &quot;rockabilly&quot;.\n          Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Roy Orbison, Sam Cooke, The Coasters, Carl Perkins, Buddy Holly, Billy Haley &amp; The Comets, The Everly Brothers, Rickie Nelson, Little Richard, LaVern Baker .............\n\n\n\n         BILL HAYLEY &amp; HIS COMETS  -  ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK  (1954)\n         CHUCK BERRY -  MAYBELLENE (1955)\n         BO DIDDLEY - BO DIDDLEY  (1955)\n         GENE VINCENT  -  BE-BOP-A-LULA  (1956)\n         LITTLE RICHARD  -  LONG TALL SALLY   (1956)\n         ELVIS PRESLEY - HEARTBREAK HOTEL (1956)\n         ELVIS PRESLEY - HOUND DOG  (1956) \n         EDDIE COCHRAN  -  TWENTY FLIGHT ROCK  (1956)\n         ELVIS PRESLEY   -   JAILHOUSE ROCK  (1957)   \n         ELVIS PRESLEY  - TOO MUCH  (1957)\n         BUDDY HOLLY &amp; THE CRICKETS  -  PEGGY SUE  (1957)\n         EDDIE COCHRAN -  SUMMERTIME BLUES  (1958)\n         EDDIE COCHRAN - C'MON EVERYBODY   (1958)\n         JERRY LEE LEWIS  -  BREATHLESS  (1958)\n         CARL PERKINS  -  GLAD ALL OVER  (1958)\n         DANNY  &amp; THE JUNIORS  - ROCK  &amp; ROLL IS HERE TO STAY   (1958)\n         DUANNE EDDY -  REBEL ROUSER  (1958)\n         CHUCK BERRY  -  JOHNNY B.GOODE  (1958) \n\n\n\n\n          06.04  ROCKABILLY  REVIVAL \n\n        Rockabilly Revival early 1970s  (return to the simple, loud, fast, emotionally-direct music of early rock and roll). Some musicians stripped their sound down to three chords, loud guitars, and shouted lyrics, creating early punk rock. Other musicians turned back to the original rock and roll music of the 1950s for inspiration, and in the late 1970s, an underground rockabilly revival began to emerge.  \n\n\n         BO DIDDLEY  -  HEY BO DIDDLEY   (1969)\n         THE HOUSESHAKERS  -  BE-BOP-A-LULA (1972)\n         HEINZ BURT  -  C'MON EVERYBODY  (1972)\n         BO DIDDLEY  -  ROAD RUNNER   (1972)\n         BILL HAYLEY &amp; HIS COMETS  - ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK  (1972) \n         LITTLE RICHARD - LUCILLE  (1972) \n         BO DIDDLEY  -  BO DIDDLEY   (1985)\n         BO DIDDLEY  -  BO PUT THE ROCK IN ROCK &amp; ROLL  (1985)\n         BO DIDDLEY  -  GUNSLINGER  (1985)\n         CHUCK BERRY  -  BIO  (1986)\n         CHUCK BERRY  -  CAROL  (1987)\n         CHUCK BERRY  -  ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN  (1987)\n\n\n\n06.05. DOO-WOP \n\n           Doo-wop is a style of vocal-based rhythm and blues music, which developed in African-American communities in the 1940s and which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1950s and 1960s With its smooth, consonant vocal harmonies, doo-wop was one of the most mainstream, pop-oriented R&amp;B styles of the 1950s and 1960s.. There is confusion regarding which recording was the &quot;first&quot; to contain the phrase &quot;doo-wop&quot;. There is general acknowledgement that the first hit record to use the syllables &quot;doo-wop&quot; in the refrain was the 1955 hit, &quot;When You Dance&quot; by The Turbans, in which the chant &quot;doo-wop&quot; can clearly be heard . Important African American doo-wop groups included The Marcels, The Coasters, The Drifters, The Moonglows, Clovers,  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Little Anthony and the Imperials,The &quot;5&quot; Royales , The Flamingos , The Dells, The Cadillacs, The Midnighters and The Platters.\n\n\n         THE PLATTERS   -  ONLY YOU  (1956)\n         THE PLATTERS   -  SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES  (1958) \n         JACKIE WILSON  - LONELY TEARDROPS   (1958)\n         JIMMY CLANTON &amp; SANDY STEWART  - DONÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½T YOU KNOW  (1959)\n         JACKIE WILSON  - I'M COMINÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ON BACK TO YOU  (1961) \n         GENE CHANDLER -  DUKE OF EARL\n         THE PLATTERS  - THE GREAT PRETENDER\n\n\n\n\n06.06. SOUL MUSIC \n\n         Soul music has its roots in gospel music and rhythm and blues. The hard gospel vocal quartets of the 1940s and 1950s were big influences on major soul singers of the 1960s. Many consider the birthplace of soul music to be northern United States inner cities, particularly Chicago. Other cities, such as New York, Detroit, Memphis and Florence, quickly followed, creating their own soul styles based on their regional gospel roots. Sam Cook, Ray Charles Solomon Burke, Little Richard, James Brown,Fats Domino and  Aretha Franklin  are considered to be one of the pioneers and founders of soul music. \n     \n          SAM COOKE  -  YOU SEND ME  (1965)\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aaafabcb42acaa7796f761f6ecf332d8bcebcf8","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+270","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aaafabcb42acaa7796f761f6ecf332d8bcebcf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,170,250,188,180,42,202,167,121,111,118,31,110,207,51,45,139,206,188,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
