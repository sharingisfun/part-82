The journal has gained a worldwide reputation, demonstrated by its high ranking in the ISI Science Citation Index, as a forum for general and specialised communication between biophysicists working in different areas. The majority of reviews published are invited from authors who have made significant contributions to the field, who give critical, readable and sometimes controversial accounts of recent progress and problems in their speciality. Thematic issues are occasionally published.\n\n- journals.cambridge.org\n\nIssue 01:\npp. 1-53. Long-range distance determinations in biomacromolecules by EPR spectroscopy\npp. 55-85. Insight into the functional versatility of RNA through model-making with applications to data fitting\npp. 87-111. Single-molecule fluorescence to study molecular motors\n\nIssue 02:\npp. 113-161. Folding of a universal ribozyme--the ribonuclease P RNA\npp. 163-189. Quantitative studies of ribosome conformational dynamics\n\nIssue 03:\npp. 191-285. X-ray solution scattering (SAXS) combined with crystallography and computation--defining accurate macromolecular structures, conformations and assemblies in solution\n\nIssue 04:\npp. 287-326. Protein folding and misfolding--mechanism and principles\npp. 327-356.
