In the past, his (uniformly fine) albums have featured guest shots and collaborations with Ry Cooder and members of the Irish trad-folk group the Chieftans, but here it's back to the roots.\n\nRecorded in a Toure's home village in Mali, with a small group of singers and players, Niafunke is delightfully low-key and captivating. Beautifully picked acoustic guitar combines with shimmering electric guitar percussion, voices, and violin to weave the spacious, circular melodies that explore the common ground shared by the blues and African folk music. &quot;Tulumba&quot; glimmers like a desert mirage, and &quot;Pieter Botha&quot; sounds like a Delta blues tune played by a wandering musician while traveling through Spain and England in the Middle Ages.\n\n\nTracklist\n1.
