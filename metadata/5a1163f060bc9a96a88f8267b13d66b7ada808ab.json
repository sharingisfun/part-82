SprovieroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gift of the year. The aim of the designer was once more to give the user the chance to play and travel from very formal and conservative letterforms to the amazing world of swashes and flourishes. Possibilities of alternating and ligating characters in this font are absolutely fantastic.\n\nAfter his last creation, Parfait Script, LiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n wanted to make a more universal font. Delighted by typographic works of Didot and his followers of the beginnings of 1800, Maximiliano R. Sproviero started what became another obsessive project, which is now named Breathe, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcuando las letras respiran...ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ what could be translated as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhen letters breatheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, due to the feeling that you are reading letters that are alive. MoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nBreathe comes in two styles which have a significant difference as regards to the quantity of glyphs available inside. If you want to get the most complete style, with over 1000 glyphs, (including contextual alternates, stylistic alternates, swashes, terminal forms, titling alternates, historical forms, stylistic sets, standard ligatures, stylistic ligatures, decorative ligatures and frames) then your choice should be Breathe Pro. On the other hand, if you are interested in having a less decorative font with the nice touch of LiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s style, then your choice should be Breathe Standard, a more limited version of Breathe, including terminal forms (leaves) and frames.\n\nWith Breathe Pro you will surely have fun at the same time you are designing and that is not an unimportant thing. The world of type-designers is growing each year, and the features of Open-Type are letting them think their creations as if they were truly pieces of art. At least, Breathe Pro is inspired in the Art of our predecessors, those who with a pen loaded of ink would decorate each letter, each page in such a lovely way. Yes, -lovely- is the word. We would not have the amazing lettering artists, calligraphers, typographers of nowadays if that -love for letters- had not traveled from generation to generation. Breathe Pro is an example of this love. An example of what Maximiliano R. Sproviero feels about typography and letters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a1163f060bc9a96a88f8267b13d66b7ada808ab","amp;dn":"Li%C3%83%C2%A1n+Types+-+Breathe+Pro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a1163f060bc9a96a88f8267b13d66b7ada808ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,17,99,240,96,188,154,150,168,143,130,103,177,61,102,183,173,168,8,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
