Jimmy's youthful good looks and constantly sunny disposition attracted comparisons with Jamie Oliver (an old friend, who partly-funded the purchase of the farm in the first place).\nThe first (2004) short-run season (four episodes) was followed up with a one-off special, Back on Jimmy's Farm, in 2005, and two further 4-part series, titled Return to Jimmy's Farm (2006) and Crisis on Jimmy's Farm (2007). 30-minute edits from the first season were aired under the title Jimmy's Farm Diaries.\n\nEpisode 2\n\nWith staff numbers down, the animals take advantage and run amok. Undaunted, Jim goes to prison to get a new boar; collects 100 demanding ex-battery hens; and struggles with an unwelcome delivery.\n\n##########AVI Information\nFilename: BBC.Jimmy's.Farm.Series.2.2of4.March.2005.avi\nFilesize: 540580248 Bytes (515,54 MB)\nStreams (i.e. Video, Audio): 2\n##########Video Stream\nCompression: divx - DivX\nAvg.
