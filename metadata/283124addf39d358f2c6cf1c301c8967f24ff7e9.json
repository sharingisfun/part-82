The namesake of the album and song of the name was inspired by the popular attire of metalheads  in the early 1980s, defined by denim pants and leather jackets. The song is seen as a tribute from the band to their fans while describing the history of the sub-culture and the rise of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM). This was the last album with the classic line up of Saxon, as drummer Pete Gill would ultimately leave the band to join MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead; this was also seen as the last of their triumvirate of classic albums (the previous two being Wheels of Steel and Strong Arm of the Law), which saw them stop making albums for over a year following the release of Denim and Leather, leading to them trying to reach mainstream success in the United States.\n\nThough the album isn't Saxon's best selling, it spawned two of their most successful singles, &quot;And the Bands Played On&quot; and &quot;Princess of the Night&quot;. There are nine songs on this album, which are noted for their heavy subject matter about a wide range of topics. &quot;Princess of the Night&quot; is a song about a powerful train and &quot;And the Bands Played On&quot; is about the resiliency of the heavy metal (particularly NWOBHM) bands. Other themes for the songs include: partying, the spirit of the music, fighting, and, like many of their songs, motorcycles.\n\nSaxon are an English heavy metal band, formed in 1976 in Barnsley, Yorkshire. As leading lights in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal they had huge success in the 1980s with 8 UK Top 40  albums including 4 UK Top 10 albums. Saxon also had numerous singles in the Top 20 singles chart. Between 1980 and 1987 Saxon established themselves as one of Europe's  biggest metal acts, they also had success in Japan and in the USA. In Japan, the single &quot;Motorcycle Man&quot; stayed in the charts for over 5 months. They still tour heavily and regularly. Their latest tour is their largest in the UK since the late 1980s. Saxon have sold more than 13 million albums worldwide and heavily influenced bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Sodom and Running Wild.\n\nThere is another incarnation of Saxon featuring two former band members who hold the legal rights to the name - &quot;Oliver/Dawson Saxon&quot;.\n\nSaxon began with a lineup of Peter &quot;Biff&quot; Byford on vocals, Paul Quinn and Graham Oliver on guitars, Steve &quot;Dobby&quot; Dawson on bass and drummer Pete &quot;Frank&quot; Gill. Early in their career the band changed their name from Son of a Bitch to Saxon, and gained support slots on tour with more established bands such as MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead.\n\nIn 1979 the band signed to the Carrere record label and released their eponymous debut album. In 1980 follow-up album Wheels of Steel (UK no 5) spawned two hit singles: the title track, and the crowd favourite &quot;747 (Strangers in the Night)&quot;. The Strong Arm of the Law album (UK no 11), considered by fans to be one of their best recordings, was released later that same year, and chart success continued with singles from their next release, Denim and Leather (1981 UK no 9). The title track to that album is seen as an anthem of the early 1980s metal movement. Later legal issues with Carrere negated most if not all of the financial gains seen during their early success.\n\nA relentless series of headlining tours around the UK capitalised on this success and a sold out tour of Europe with support act Ozzy Osbourne highlighted Saxon's immense ability on the road and was set in stone with the live release The Eagle Has Landed (1982 UK no 5).\n\nAs the NWOBHM movement began to fade 1983's Power &amp; the Glory, their highest selling album to date, saw Saxon establish themselves as one of the major European metal acts together with Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. The &quot;Power and Glory Tour&quot; of 1983 was an arena tour that began in Europe and was a huge success. The US leg of the tour with support act Accept proved successful and Saxon found themselves on the verge of becoming a major act in the US as the album, in its first week of release, sold more than 15,000 copies in Los Angeles alone. The emerging Glam Metal scene in America would however put a dent in the bands conquest of the American market.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:283124addf39d358f2c6cf1c301c8967f24ff7e9","amp;dn":"Saxon+-+Midnight+Rider+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"283124addf39d358f2c6cf1c301c8967f24ff7e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,49,36,173,223,57,211,88,242,198,207,28,48,28,137,103,242,79,247,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
