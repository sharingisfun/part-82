I left all of the tags as is (except for the track numbers) so you guys get the credit you deserve.\n\n\nBe sure to check smashingpumpkins.com any day now for the free download of the 6th Teargarden track, and be sure to request the current single, Freak, on your local rock radio station.\n\nRock on,\n\n\nsin_eater\n\n\n\n\n* these are considered bonus tracks, and therefore will have to be deleted if you are going to burn this to a one 80min CD. Sorry for the inconsonance but I thought they were worth including.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99b78682b2112501f5b8fe8dc8b94abbe1c88993","amp;dn":"The+Smashing+Pumpkins+Live+-+The+Teargarden+Tour+%5B2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99b78682b2112501f5b8fe8dc8b94abbe1c88993","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,183,134,130,178,17,37,1,245,184,254,141,200,185,74,187,225,200,137,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
