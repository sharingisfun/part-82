The first half of the film examines three periods from the 20th century: Central America in the 1950s and 1960s(CIA coups in Guatemala and Cuba); Italy during the Cold War (NATO's Operation Gladio); Afghanistan and the Balkans in the 1980s and 1990s (Operation Cyclone and the wars in the former Yugoslavia).  \n\nThough the movie does not explore 9/11 in detail, it functions as a detailed account of false flag terrorism in general, and so speaks to the debate about 9/11 as much as it does to the debate about 7/7.  The second half of the film examines 7/7 in details, and concludes with a lengthy discussion on intelligence and security policy.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://911blogger.com/news/2010-08-31/77-seeds-deconstruction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://911blogger.com/news/2010-08-31/77-seeds-deconstruction&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5517c82fff15c4ee418a43207b165bf05cc87392","amp;dn":"7%2F7%3A+Seeds+of+Deconstruction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5517c82fff15c4ee418a43207b165bf05cc87392","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,23,200,47,255,21,196,238,65,138,67,32,123,22,91,240,92,200,115,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
