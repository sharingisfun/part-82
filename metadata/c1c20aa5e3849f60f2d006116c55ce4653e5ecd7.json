The Greens share musical aspirations, but daughter Rachel (Madeline Zima), a talented violinist, is the one most likely to achieve them. Norman (Tom Irwin) is a dairy farmer and Ingrid (Glenne Headly) is a choir director who abandoned the piano when she married and settled down, but the Greens are a happy family, for the most part. The trick is finding a way to reconcile their dreams with a reality that may hold more riches than they realize. When Norman gets a chance to conduct the local orchestra for the Dairy Days celebration, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an opportunity for the family to come together, not just with each other, but with a community they had never fully appreciated.\n\n\nVideo Bitrate..: 810 kbps\nAudio Codec....: MP3 VBR Stereo\nAudio Bitrate..: 130 kbps\nAspect Ratio...: 1.33:1\nResolution.....: 512 x 384\nFrame Rate.....: 23.976 fps\nGenre..........: Drama/Music\nRuntime........: 100 mins\nRAR Count......: 50x15\nAudio Language.: English\nSubtitles......: N/A\nDVD Date.......: N/A\nRelease Date...: 09.11.2010\nIMDB Rating....: 6.1/10 (168 votes) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1c20aa5e3849f60f2d006116c55ce4653e5ecd7","amp;dn":"The.Sandy.Bottom.Orchestra.2000.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1c20aa5e3849f60f2d006116c55ce4653e5ecd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,194,10,165,227,132,159,96,242,208,6,17,108,85,206,70,83,229,236,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
