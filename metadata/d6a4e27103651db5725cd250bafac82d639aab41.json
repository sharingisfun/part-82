(ISBN 0929385225)\n\nWritten after Cooper had been a member of the US Naval Intelligence Briefing\nTeam of the Commander\nin Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, the book details many of Cooper's\nclaims about the\nalleged influence of UFOs on US government agencies, and the New World Order,\nthe assassination of\nPresident John F. Kennedy.\n\nAnother claim made in the book pertains to his own death. William Cooper,\nseemingly paranoid, claimed\nthat he would be shot to death on his own property. True to his &quot;fate,&quot; he was\ngunned down in precisely\nthis manner years after publishing the book and settling down in Arizona.\n\nThe title of the book alludes to a passage in the Bible, Revelation 6:8:\n\n&quot;And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death,\nand Hell followed with him.&quot;\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Cooper's death are controversial. On November 5,\n2001,\nofficers of the Apache County Sheriff's Office decided to serve Cooper a warrant\nbased on the above\nmentioned charges. For reasons not explained, the Sheriff's Office sent deputies\nto Cooper's home at\napproximately 11:00PM, and instead of knocking on his door and announcing\nthemselves, the deputies\nattempted to lure Cooper from his house by posing as civilians playing loud\nmusic on or near his\nproperty. Cooper, who was an above the knee amputee, went down to investigate\nthe scene in his truck.\nIt is disputed whether the deputies identified themselves or tried to serve an\narrest warrant at that\ntime. Nevertheless, Cooper announced he was returning to his house to contact\nthe Eager Police Department,\neither to verify the warrant or to contact the local authorities in order to\nreport what he may have\nstill believed was a real disturbance. Before he could do so however, the\nsheriff's deputies tried to\napprehend him, at which point shooting began. Although it is unclear who began\nfiring, there are some\nwho question the uncertain circumstances, and who was responsible for first\nshots fired. Independent\ninvestigators questioned who would fire first at a double amputee, and Cooper's\nsupporters claimed it\nwas a convenient death, given the close proximity to the September 11th attacks,\nof which Cooper had\nalready spoken out, with allegations that subsequently would find voice with the\nlarge 9/11 Truth Movement.\nCooper was armed and one deputy was wounded. Another deputy returned fire,\nkilling Cooper.\nMilton William Cooper was 58 years old.\n\nThe truth is, an alien or demonic invasion isn't coming.. it's already here!\n\nFor some reason most of churchdumb believes the Nephilim race was destroyed by\nthe flood..\nthen where did Goliath come from? The Amalek, the Kenites, all the 18 hybrid\ncities Joshua\ndestroyed to reclaim the land of Israel? They didn't go anywhere, except maybe\nunderground..\nto perfect dna mixing..to come out again in the last days undetected.\n\nThey've perfected the giant gene defect. In fact, now they can shop in our\nstores, sit next\nto us on a bus, and most wouldn't know any different. They look human..but they\nare not.\nThey are the tares sown into the wheat.\n\nThe church has been silent about UFOs and abductions. About hybridization, fetus\nthefts, the\nimpregnation of women by these beings.\n\nNow that they've assimilated into our population as star children, politicians\nand civilians,\nwho can detect them?\n\nIt's time to get informed on what's going on.\n\nJoe Blow recommends these websites: \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.concen.cc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.concen.cc&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.umunu.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.umunu.com&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theinfounderground.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theinfounderground.com&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iamthewitness.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iamthewitness.com&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.wakeupfromyourslumber.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.wakeupfromyourslumber.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSend tips to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;771d1812151b180037021a0219025914181a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; or call skype:joeblowman\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6a4e27103651db5725cd250bafac82d639aab41","amp;dn":"WILLIAM+COOPER+-+BEHOLD+A+PALE+HORSE%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6a4e27103651db5725cd250bafac82d639aab41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,164,226,113,3,101,29,181,114,92,210,80,186,250,200,45,99,154,171,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
