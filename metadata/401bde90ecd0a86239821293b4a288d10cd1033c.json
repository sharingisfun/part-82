He quickly finds his own name listed    \n    under his mother's family name, McCausland, and decides   \n    to follow this line to find out more. Moving up the        \n    family tree he finds a relative who holds an honoured     \n    position in the Royal household of the day.              \n                                                              \n    Delving into more family papers, Alexander finds a         \n    letter from a direct ancestor over two hundred years      \n    ago, complaining about the shortcoming of her wastrel    \n    eldest son Edward. Alexander discovers that Edward        \n    inherits his baronetcy from a cousin and that foul play    \n    is suspected. Alexander's aristocratic roots are          \n    confirmed.                                               \n                                                              \n    Searching even further back following a fascinating        \n    trail of ancient documents Alexander finds out that he    \n    has even more titled relatives descended from one of     \n    the richest families in Britain and intimately            \n    connected to the King. One is a Royalist military          \n    leader during the Civil War, who ploughs all his money    \n    into the King's cause. But in a curious twist of fate    \n    he ends up being tried for High Treason and finishing     \n    his days in a most unexpected way.                         \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n    We're sorry for the delay in releasing this, but there     \n    was a problem with the original airing, so we waited for  \n    the re-run.                                              \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:401bde90ecd0a86239821293b4a288d10cd1033c","amp;dn":"Who.Do.You.Think.You.Are.UK.Alexander.Armstrong.S07E06.720p.HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"401bde90ecd0a86239821293b4a288d10cd1033c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,27,222,144,236,208,168,98,57,130,18,147,180,162,136,209,12,209,3,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
