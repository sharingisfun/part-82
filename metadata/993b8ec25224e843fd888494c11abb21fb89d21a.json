Aplogies to all.\n\nHere's a nice collection of live studio and concert performances spanning the years 1969-1975. First up, is an appearance on the &quot;Phonzeit tv program in 1975, on January,18th with timecode. There are discussion segments as indicated in the running order notes,which cut into the songs,and be forewarned: German language, and no subtitles. However, I have included an un-cut Surrounded By The Stars from the show. That's the only one available though.   \nFollowing that, is a collection of various live concert and studio performances(look closely and you'll spot David Gilmour!) including the aforementioned un-cut Surrounded By The Stars. All in all, great audio and visual quality and a real keeper for the heavy Amon Duul II fan. Thanks goes to Olvator at Dimeadozen, for the Phonzeit torrent.\n \nRunning Time:1:07:02\n\nRunning Order:\n\n01. Archy the Robot\n02. Lonely Woman\n03.
