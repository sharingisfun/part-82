On THIRD GENERATION BLUES Merle's son Richard takes up the baton, and the result is an album that recalls Doc and Merle's glory days. Doc's calmly intense vocals are as effective as ever. Time may have snuck his voice a bit lower in register, but that only adds to its often-chilling resonance.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of this album is that, while it digs deeps into the folk traditions of American music, it doesn't contain many actual bluegrass songs. From the blues chestnut &quot;Honey Please Don't Go&quot; (more commonly known as &quot;Baby Please Don't Go&quot;) to &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; and Tim Hardin's folk-rock ballad &quot;If I Were A Carpenter,&quot; Doc and Richard weave disparate musical strands into an appealing garment that bears an authentic bluegrass veneer.\n\nRecorded at The Loft, Boone, North Carolina and in Falls Church, Virginia.\n\nPersonnel: Don Watson (vocals, guitar, harmonica); Richard Watson (guitar).\n\nAudio Mixer: Bill Wolf .\n\nRecording information: Falls Church, VA; The Loft, Boone, NC.\n\nPhotographer: Rosa Lee Watson.\n\nPersonnel: Doc Watson (vocals, guitar, harmonica); Richard Watson (guitar); T. Michael Coleman (bass).\n\nDirty Linen (8-9/99, p.72) - &quot;...nicely recorded, well performed, and there seems to be a musical chemistry between the players.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76000512626450913c0e88de7909337512e80e93","amp;dn":"Doc+%26+Richard+Watson+-+Third+Generation+Blues+%281999%29+FLAC+%2B+%5B320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76000512626450913c0e88de7909337512e80e93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,0,5,18,98,100,80,145,60,14,136,222,121,9,51,117,18,232,14,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
