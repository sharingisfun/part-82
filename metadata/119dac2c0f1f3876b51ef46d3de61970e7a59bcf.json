Chulbul(Salman Khan) takes on a gang of about a dozen criminals by himself, using only a firehose as a weapon. There are a few instances of Matrix-inspired special effects, but they are outshone by the intricate fight choreography, as Chulbul is surrounded by attackers.\n\nThe rest of the police force arrives while Chulbul exits the warehouse with a bag of pilfered cash. Asked what they should tell the higher-ups about the fight, Chulbul shoots a deputy in the arm, so that the officer can claim he was wounded in action and earn a promotion. Everyone is happy, and Chulbul walks away with the money.\n\nThe scene is immediately followed by a dance number to a tune about what a badass Chulbul is: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHud Hud Dabanng.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nDabanngÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s plot is formulaic, with the requisite love story and predictable double-crosses. Chulbul falls in love with a woman, Rajjo (Sonakshi Sinha), who encourages him to reconcile with his estranged stepbrother, Makhi (Arbaaz Khan), and his step-father. Little does Chulbul know that Makhi is secretly working for Cheddi Singh (Sonu Sood), the corrupt politician from whom Chulbul stole in the opening sequence.\n\nDabanng is well-paced and doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t linger over ChulbulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s emotional development. He grows as a character, but the majority of his time is spent fighting, engaging in political intrigue, and dancing.\n\n\nCAST:\n\nSalman Khan as Chulbul Pandey\nSonakshi Sinha as Rajo\nArbaaz Khan as Makhanchan\nSonu Sood as Chhedi Singh\nMahie Gill as Nirmala\nVinod Khanna as Prajapati Pandey\nDimple Kapadia as Naini Devi\nOm Puri as Kasturilal Vishkarma\nAnupam Kher as Dayal Babu\nTinu Anand as Masterji (Nirmala's father)\nMahesh Manjrekar as Haria (Rajo's father)\nMalaika Arora as Munni\nMurali Sharma as ACP Malik\nAmitosh Nagpal as Sumant Kumar (Rajo's brother)\nUmesh Tonpe as Inspector Choube\nRam Sujan Singh as Chaubeji\nRajeev Mishra as Toluram Rastogi\nShayamlal as Photographer\n\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/23000/22473.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/23000/22473.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/23000/22474.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/23000/22474.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:119dac2c0f1f3876b51ef46d3de61970e7a59bcf","amp;dn":"Dabangg+%282010%29+1CD+-+DVDRIP+-+XviD+-+SRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"119dac2c0f1f3876b51ef46d3de61970e7a59bcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,157,172,44,15,31,56,118,181,30,244,109,61,230,25,112,231,165,155,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
