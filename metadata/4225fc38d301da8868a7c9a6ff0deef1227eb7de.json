Keith Ellison on Tea Party Anti-Muslim Bigotry, US-backed Assassinations in Yemen, and the Firing of Juan Williams\n\nA prominent leader of the Tea Party movement recently said he was working to unseat Minnesota Democrat Rep. Keith Ellison in part because he is a Muslim. Judson Phillips, the founder of the Tea Party Nation, urged Minnesota voters to elect Ellison's independent challenger, Lynn Torgerson, on Tuesday. &quot;A majority of Tea Party members, I suspect, are not fans of Islam,&quot; Phillips said.

On Sunday, Dilma Rousseff defeated rival JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Serra with 55 percent in a runoff vote. Rousseff was outgoing Brazilian President Luiz InÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡cio Lula da Silva's chosen successor after serving the last five years as his chief of staff. During the 1960s and 1970s, she was involved in the armed struggle against Brazil's military dictatorship. She was imprisoned for nearly three years and tortured. Among her pledges, Rousseff vowed to eradicate chronic poverty in Brazil affecting 20 million people. We talk with Michael Fox, an independent journalist and documentary filmmaker based outside Porto Alegre. &quot;She's a fighter,&quot; Fox says.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4225fc38d301da8868a7c9a6ff0deef1227eb7de","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+01+nov+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4225fc38d301da8868a7c9a6ff0deef1227eb7de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,37,252,56,211,1,218,136,104,167,201,166,255,13,238,241,34,126,183,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
