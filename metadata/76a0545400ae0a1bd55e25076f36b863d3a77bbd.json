Then, with a nice 1-hour continuous mix finally laid out, I wanted to put it on CD. So the cue file was born. Then, the problem... the only discs I have are inkjet printable. Needs some label art. So the label was born. Then I wanted a nice cover art to put on it so foobar2000 doesn't look all desolate and blank. And I wanted a nice back cover for the disc as well. So the front and back cover art was born as well. Now, there's about 3 weeks of work put into this thing, and I know the world would love to have it.\n\nDon't get your panties in a bunch just yet... but the source for most of these songs (except a couple) were 320k or V0 MP3s bought online from sites like Beatport. Hence providing a FLAC download as well as the standard MP3 download, so with the FLAC download you can enjoy the original quality without further degradation. The V0 MP3 is a smaller download but with minor degradation due to lossy-lossy encoding on many songs.\n\nWithout further adieu, here's the list of tracks:\n#01] BSOD - This Is The Hook\n#02] Deadmau5 - Ghosts N Stuff feat. Rob Swire\n#03] Alex Metric - What Now\n#04] Boys Noize - Kontact Me\n#05] Modeselektor - Suckerpin\n#06] Ralph Falcon - Break You (Cube Guys Radio Edit)\n#07] Alex Metric - Head Straight\n#08] Fake Blood - Blood Splashing\n#09] Phoenix - Lisztomania (Alex Metric Remix)\n#10] Cascada - Evacuate The Dancefloor (PH Elektro Edit)\n#11] The Crystal Method - Busy Child (Sta Remix)\n#12] Alex Metric - Whatshewants\n#13] The Crystal Method - Cherry Twist (Deadmau5 Remix)\n#14] Sub Focus - Could This Be Real (Extended Mix)\n#15] The Slew - It's All Over\n\nEnjoy! Also, for the geeks out there, check out the F4UBCD, you won't be disappointed. ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76a0545400ae0a1bd55e25076f36b863d3a77bbd","amp;dn":"FalconFour+-+Fifth+Letter+of+the+Alphabet+%28House+nogap+mix%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76a0545400ae0a1bd55e25076f36b863d3a77bbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,160,84,84,0,174,10,27,213,94,37,7,111,54,184,99,211,167,123,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
