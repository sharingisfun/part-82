When his father dies, it is up to Aaron, the oldest son, to organize the funeral and give the eulogy. The funeral takes place in his father's home and Aaron tries to put on an appropriate expression on his face to welcome his relatives, including his famous writer brother Ryan (Martin Lawrence), and his father's friends. But preserving a civil atmosphere will be a hard thing to do, especially, when from the very start, the undertaker makes a horrifying mistake. And Ryan wants to be the celebrity of the event without paying for anything. But those incidents are only minor compared to the information that Aaron and Ryan get from Frank (Peter Dinklage) the mysterious dwarf who is attending the funeral and nobody seems to know.\n\n[img]http://a.imageshack.us/img202/4358/90288518.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\n[img]http://a.imageshack.us/img688/7513/93434814.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\n[img]http://a.imageshack.us/img688/7780/49566556.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\n[img]http://signatures.mylivesignature.com/54488/175/E4FA621861A51E09B44842B10595E2EB.png[/img]\n\n\n\n\nGreetz to Fabreezy ,Imagine ,Flawle33 ,Santi ,Vision ,Kingdom ,Tank66 ,Xclusive66 ,Prism ,Noir ,BDK ,TA and all other uploaders who serve the community\n\n\nYeah everyones got this by now but ive had it since yesterday and its a slightly smaller file size so here it is if you want it !\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:263a5d13a2ce7393bbf4cea959bd105909f62a9b","amp;dn":"Death+At+A+Funeral+XviD+DvDrip+SAFCuk009%2BFabreezy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"263a5d13a2ce7393bbf4cea959bd105909f62a9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,58,93,19,162,206,115,147,187,244,206,169,89,189,16,89,9,246,42,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
