Each piece starts as a blank canvas with no preconceived notion of where the music will go. Notes and noises are played from synths, guitar, voice and samples and fed into one or two loops which repeat and layer and decay. These loops can be quite long, so as a performer I can add notes as I see fit, but only have a certain amount of control over what is heard - the rest is serendipity. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bfwrecordings.com/bingsatellites/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bfwrecordings.com/bingsatellites/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:379641e668e03697ff86695aa542eb116d9de2fc","amp;dn":"Bing+Satellites+-+Twilight+Sessions+volume+2+%5Blive+ambient%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"379641e668e03697ff86695aa542eb116d9de2fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,150,65,230,104,224,54,151,255,134,105,90,165,66,235,17,109,157,226,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
