Hosted by Aamer Haleem, the show documented the attempted reuniting of a formerly popular musical ensemble for a special concert in either London or Los Angeles.\n\nA show normally consisted of the crew first hunting down the ex-members of the band (often first in disguise) one-by-one, and convincing them to agree for the one-time concert; the members were &quot;contracted&quot; by signing a record album by their former band. The band members were then interviewed, usually focusing on the reasons of the breakup. The final segment would consist of the formal reunion of the band in the rehearsing studio, and a joint interview about why the group parted ways. If the reunion was successful, the episode ended with the final performance.\n\nFrankie Goes To Hollywood: All members reunited, but Holly Johnson refused to perform.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7ef8473bceaedc5f801ede7183aa05d42d48daf","amp;dn":"Frankie+Goes+To+Hollywood+-+VH1+Bands+Reunited+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7ef8473bceaedc5f801ede7183aa05d42d48daf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,239,132,115,188,234,237,197,248,1,237,231,24,58,160,93,66,212,141,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
