Krusty picks Homer to accompany him to Oslo for the awards ceremony, since Homer will laugh at anything Krusty says, and Homer decides to take Bart with him. Their plane lands not in Oslo, but in The Hague, and it is revealed that the Peace Prize announcement was a ruse to bring Krusty here so he could be tried by the World Court for his deplorable public behavior over the years. Homer and Bart search desperately for any evidence to show that Krusty has made a genuine contribution to humanity, and eventually argue that his refusal to perform at a particular show led directly to the South African government's decision to release Nelson Mandela from prison. The court accepts this argument and frees Krusty, who immediately seeks out the nearest place to buy drugs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the courthouse cafeteria ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and agrees to bring some back for the presiding judge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d934994fec37cd8a5f2ae1c15afca3408db0f89","amp;dn":"The+simpsons+s22e01+LOL.+%7EINVICTA+RG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d934994fec37cd8a5f2ae1c15afca3408db0f89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,147,73,148,254,195,124,216,165,242,174,28,21,175,202,52,8,219,15,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
