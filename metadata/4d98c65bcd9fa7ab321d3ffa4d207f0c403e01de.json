Realizing he has a bad heart, Grimm extracts promises and concessions from those he expects will survive him and draws up his will appropriately. He extracts a promise from his beloved foster daughter Catherine that she will marry his newly-arrived nephew Frederik although she loves James, a hired hand on the farm. Grimm's hopes that the farm will remain in the family are given a blow when the mercenary Frederik announces his intentions to sell the entire operation to a hated Grimm rival When Grimm returns as a spirit he discovers a terrible situation of his own creation. His &quot;friends&quot; are dissatisfied with their bequests, young William's health is failing, and Catherine seems headed for an unhappy marriage. Through the dying William and his old friend and confidante, Dr. Macpherson, Grimm's spirit tries to reverse the harm he's done.\n\nLionel Barrymore\t\tPeter Grimm\nHelen Mack\t\t\tCatherine\nEdward Ellis\t\t\tDr. Andrew Macpherson\n\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Simple@L3\n      Format settings, BVOP : No\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 22mn\n      Bit rate : 1 057 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.500\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Standard : NTSC\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.102\n      Stream size : 621 MiB (88%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 22mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 124 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 72.8 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.72 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 483 ms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d98c65bcd9fa7ab321d3ffa4d207f0c403e01de","amp;dn":"The+Return+of+Peter+Grimm+%281935%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d98c65bcd9fa7ab321d3ffa4d207f0c403e01de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,152,198,91,205,159,167,171,50,29,63,250,77,32,127,12,64,62,1,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
