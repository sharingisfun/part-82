It's a first for the Australian Navy and for       \n   Toowoomba's new Captain, Commander Ivan Ingham. Before they can go    \n    they face a Mission-Readiness test, a week of intensive simulated    \n    warfare exercises. Their endurance under relentless pressure and     \n    ability to deal with emergencies effectively and quickly will be.    \n       It's a rollercoaster week, of air and small boat attacks, a       \n     real-life helicopter breakdown, exhaustion and frayed tempers.      \n    Gradually, the crew of Toowoomba begin to turn it around and show    \n         the kind of teamwork and determination they'll need for         \n      operational deployment. They pass the test and farewell their      \n       families.
