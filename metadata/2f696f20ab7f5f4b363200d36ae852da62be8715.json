He knows first hand what it's like to pretend to be someone you are not. He's also only too aware of how easy it is to lose your own identity when you've lived a lie for the previous 15 years as a Dublin money launderer and bagman for the Turkish mafia and the past will not go away.\nCompleting the team are Tessa Stein, IT expert in everything from trawling databases to cracking security codes, DS Anthony Wareing who has his eye on promotion and a stance on cases that can err on the self-righteous, and DC Jose Rodriguez cocky, self-assured yet with a seriousness and sensitivity that gives him insight into cases.\nAs the series unfolds, DS Wareing becomes more and more concerned about Bloom's methods and frustrated by what he sees as Martha's blind and foolish indulgence of him.\n\n\nFormat :\tXvid\nFile size:  \t350MiB avg per episode\nDuration : \t47min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t624 pixels\nHeight : \t352 pixels\nAspect ratio : \t16:9\nFrame rate : \t25 fps\nAudio: \t\tMP3\nNr of Files:    6\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original filenames intact, I don't take credit for what I didn't do!
