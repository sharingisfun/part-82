Now this has been labelled as a DVDSCR and I'm not totally convinced myself this is a true DVDSCR but I have left the label the same as the previous group did. Obviously a massive improvement on the last and no doubt an even better copy will be availiable! But I have tinkered away with this and hopefully noticeable improvements will make this version a bit better.\n\nWork done: \n\nWell it has got it's flaws no doubt the colouring was all over the place and just a bit sketchy throughout. I added a smoothing filter as it was looking a bit rough around the edges. I have also increased contrast and brighness too. Too much brightness and contrast increases the video noise so I did add a filter for this. Now the colours in my opinion there was too much yellow and green I have lowered these two colours the yellow especially and increased the red and cyan. I added more colour saturation too by about 10%. Audio seemed ok I have not touched this. Apologise for it coming out a little larger than the original file but oh well!\n\n\nPlease check out the sample and screenshots before downloading.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ad0ca24c2ab62d61ae8f8674363dfab3c120c54","amp;dn":"Toy.Story.3.DVDSCR+-+JamBo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ad0ca24c2ab62d61ae8f8674363dfab3c120c54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,208,202,36,194,171,98,214,26,232,248,103,67,99,223,171,60,18,12,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
