This one with Pierre Favre, the drummer she's known perhaps the\nlongest since her defection from the world of classical music, is also the most\ncompelling by far on a number of levels. For one thing, this is decidedly a jazz\ndate, unlike the ones with Han Bennink or Louis Moholo. For another, there is no\nfight here, no battle for supremacy or to display &quot;chops&quot; to the other. Over the\n11 selections recorded live in Bern, the sheer musicality of this pair is\nstaggering. Schweizer's muscular chromaticism is matched in texture by Favre's\ndancing tom-tom runs and slippery snare work. When Favre does let loose,\nskittering across the cymbals and hi-hat before tearing loose on the snare, his\nhandiwork is met by large comped-up chords that seem to react rhythmically to\nhis jagged pulse on the skins. When the pace turns to dynamic sweetness and\nlight -- or perhaps twilight, as Schweizer's harmonic sensibility is wont to\nfrom time to time because of her comfort with all things consonant -- and\ntrickles of Schubert or even Haydn slip from her fingers, Favre's brushes play\naccents on the rhythm, almost inaudibly. This is a topnotch live set that\nreveals piano and drum pairings are not always percussive pound-a-thons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71ae65da0c90ef475a7fa0340419780e2bdbae39","amp;dn":"Irene+Schweizer+%26+Pierre+Favre+-+Irene+Schweizer+%26+Pierre+Favre+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71ae65da0c90ef475a7fa0340419780e2bdbae39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,174,101,218,12,144,239,71,90,127,160,52,4,25,120,14,43,219,174,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
