Growing up in the small town of Goshen, Indiana the two girls couldn't be more different. Sarah is a star pupil and athlete, a 100-watt-bulb in a five-watt-town, while Jillian is star mischief-maker, a 100lbs-of-trouble in a five-pound-bag. Although both girls long to be break free of the small-town life, Jillian is the first to act, revealing to Sarah that she has been meeting men on-line with the sole purpose of finding someone who will &quot;take her away from this place&quot;. Soon thereafter, she disappears leaving Sarah with only a journal and a cryptic video message sent from her cell-phone. Sarah soon discovers that the town would rather forget that Jillian had ever existed. Distraught, she delves into the secrets surrounding her disappearance. Aided by, Jasper, the resident computer geek who secretly adores her, the two plunge head-long into Goshen's dark secrets -- uncovering corrupt police, jilted boyfriends, a mother driven mad by loss, and an unsolved string of child abductions. The final truth they unearth will rock the town to its foundations.\n\nCast\nAnna Kendrick\t... \tSarah\nPaul Wesley\t... \tBilly\nTania Raymonde\t... \tJillian\nChuck Carter\t... \tJasper\nOlivia Dawn York\t... \tDarla Tod\nJeffrey Daniel Phillips\t... \tOfficer Berg\nShannon Holt\t... \tPatty Melville\nKinna McInroe\t... \tCandy\nJon Gries\t... \tMr. Tod\nDan Flannery\t... \tMr. Palomino\nSuzanne Lang\t... \tMaureen\nEddie Martinez\t... \tJonas\nJoshua Swanson\t... \tChris\nHoli Tavernier\t... \tJanet Melville\nPasquale Chase Rulli\t... \tBilly's Customer\n\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0874271/\n\nVideo:\nLength: 1:46:11\nFrame Width: 1280px\nFrame Height: 720px\nBitrate: 2237/kbps\nFrame Rate: 23/fps\nSize: 1.66GB\n\nAudio:\nBitrate: 237/kbps\nChannels: 6\n\nTested and works on PS3\n\nPlease Say Thanks And SEED!\n\nSCREENS: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/laNdNaAcL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/laNdNaAcL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/lANdoAacL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/lANdoAacL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/landpaacl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/landpaacl&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b49667e6b1143926685ac51cb1693f1652666c3d","amp;dn":"Elsewhere%282009%29.BRRip.x264%5BSacredMyst%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b49667e6b1143926685ac51cb1693f1652666c3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,150,103,230,177,20,57,38,104,90,197,28,177,105,63,22,82,102,108,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
