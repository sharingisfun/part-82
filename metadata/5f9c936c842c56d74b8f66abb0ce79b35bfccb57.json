His earliest recordings were made with an internal microphone deck.  In late 1974 he bought a Sony TC-152SD tape recorder, a Sony ECM-99 stereo microphone, and began using Maxell cassettes.  He also had a friend who provided excellent taping seats for many shows, resulting in high quality recordings.  In 1977, he switched over to a Nakamichi 550 tape recorder, two Nakamichi CM-300 microphones, and continued using Maxell cassettes.\n\nHe recorded many of the major 70's bands:  Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Queen, Blue Oyster Cult, Frank Zappa, Jethro Tull, ELP, Kiss, Black Sabbath, The Who, Al Stewart, Alice Cooper, Jeff Beck, Bruce Springsteen, Supertramp, Jean-Luc Ponty, Moody Blues, Neil Young, The Faces, Rush, Rick Wakeman, Kansas, as well as lesser-known acts.\n\nDan never traded copies of his recordings, although he did give some copies away to friends.  These releases are the first time most of these recordings have ever circulated, and are direct from his master cassettes.\n\nThe transfers are available as 16bit/44.1KHz flac files suitable for CD burning, and also as 24bit/96KHz flac files for those who prefer the higher resolution.\n\nNo EQ'ing has been done.  Feel free to EQ, matrix, patch, etc and re-post if you like, just give Dan Credit for the original recording.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f9c936c842c56d74b8f66abb0ce79b35bfccb57","amp;dn":"Supertramp+-+Orpheum+Theatre+1977+%5B24%2F96%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f9c936c842c56d74b8f66abb0ce79b35bfccb57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,156,147,108,132,44,86,215,75,143,102,171,176,206,121,179,91,252,203,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
