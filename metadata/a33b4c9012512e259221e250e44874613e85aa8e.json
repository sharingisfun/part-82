Besides your 6 closest friends, \nthere are 20 other characters to meet during the course of the game - \nincluding prospective boyfriends. The scenarios are presented by way of video \nclips. Conversations come about by selecting one of several provided replies.\n\nThere are various types of mini-games to solve within the game including \nvariations of Concentration and Tetris as well as a shooting accuracy game \nand a picture puzzle.\n\nThe game comes on 6 CD-Roms: 1 for the main game, 4 for the main boyfriends \nand a bonus music CD. A optional complete internet access package is included \non the discs. The PC version box also contains some makeup and tips on how to \napply it, and a pink ribbon promoting Breast Cancer Awareness.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnpack, burn or mount, install &amp; play.\n\n\nI am able to run Win95 games on my Windows 7 OS using VMLite XP Mode\n\nMy first torrent.  \nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a33b4c9012512e259221e250e44874613e85aa8e","amp;dn":"McKenzie+%26+Co+and+McKenzie+%26+Co%3A+More+Friends+with+Bonus+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a33b4c9012512e259221e250e44874613e85aa8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,59,76,144,18,81,46,37,146,33,226,80,228,72,116,97,62,133,170,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
