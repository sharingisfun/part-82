Before its recording, original bassist Tom Petersson  rejoined the group and Epic had determined that it was going to help with some of the songwriting, and the band acquiesced only to save their contract. Ironically, &quot;factory ballad&quot; The Flame  became a #1 hit single, and the album went platinum. However, the band still points to this album as the one that restricted their range and boxed them into a sound that would eventually stall their recording career for most of the 1990s.\n\nPetersson rejoined the group in 1987 and helped record 1988's Lap of Luxury, produced by Richie Zito. Due to the band's commercial decline, Epic Records forced the band to collaborate with professional songwriters. &quot;The Flame&quot;, a typical '80s &quot;factory ballad,&quot; was issued as the first single and became the band's first-ever #1 single. The second single, a cover of Elvis Presley's &quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot; also reached the top 10. Three other singles from the album were &quot;Ghost Town&quot;, &quot;Never Had A Lot To Lose&quot;, and &quot;Let Go&quot;. Each one charted successfully, and Lap of Luxury went platinum and became recognized as the band's comeback album.\n\nCheap Trick is an American rock band from Rockford, Illinois, formed in 1974. The band consists of members Robin Zander (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Rick Nielsen (lead guitar, backing vocals), Tom Petersson (electric bass, backing vocals), and Bun E. Carlos (drums, percussion).\n\nCheap Trick created a substantial fan base through its own brand of power pop music with a hard-edged yet melodic pop sound that combined the catchiness of The Beatles with the speed and energy of punk rock. The Los Angeles Times has remarked that &quot;Cheap Trick gained fame by twisting the Beatlesque into something shinier, harder, more American.&quot; Their biggest hits include &quot;Surrender&quot;, &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot;, &quot;Dream Police&quot;, and &quot;The Flame&quot;. Cheap Trick also performed a cover version of Big Star's &quot;In the Street&quot; as the theme song for That '70s Show from the second season onward and the theme song &quot;Baby Muggles&quot; for The Colbert Report.\n\nAs of 2009[update], Cheap Trick continues to tour with their most well known lineup. They have often been referred to in the Japanese press as the &quot;American Beatles&quot;. The Illinois State Senate has declared April 1 to be &quot;Cheap Trick Day&quot; in the state. The band was also ranked #25 in VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19761597d4c3b8a9a4dce3d7d88ed6afced99116","amp;dn":"Cheap+Trick+-+Never+Had+A+Lot+To+Lose+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19761597d4c3b8a9a4dce3d7d88ed6afced99116","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,118,21,151,212,195,184,169,164,220,227,215,216,142,214,175,206,217,145,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
