Things improve when he meets Alex - an aspiring model headed for New York - and a fast-talking pal promises to set up the demo. Then new setbacks: Alex isn't faithful, mom rejects him, rifts surface with his friends, and he's mugged by rivals. Everything hinges on the next rap showdown at the club. Can B-Rabbit pull truth out of his cap?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e69de5235cc93636e66793991765e17688983305","amp;dn":"8+Mile","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e69de5235cc93636e66793991765e17688983305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,157,229,35,92,201,54,54,230,103,147,153,23,101,225,118,136,152,51,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
