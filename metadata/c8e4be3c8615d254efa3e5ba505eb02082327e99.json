The show often derives humor from the fact that the characters are not primarily forensic pathologists. Davison's character, Anthony Webster, is frequently at pains to explain that he is a histopathologist, for example. Their case load therefore infrequently verges into the more &quot;exciting&quot; area of crime-related death. Nevertheless, one of the running gags of the programme was that the character originally played by Tracy-Ann Oberman, the anatomical pathologist Ruth Anderson, was secondarily credentialed as a forensic pathologist, but had so rarely used these skills that her deductive reasoning skills were faulty.\n\nTwo other major themes can be seen throughout the history of the programme. One is the desire, especially on the part of Donaldson and Webster, to educate the public about pathology. Various schemes, notably including the first radio broadcast of an autopsy, are hatched to accomplish this goal. Another predominant theme is the effect of a career in pathology on the personal lives of its practitioners. This is especially evident in Series 3 where every character has at least a subplot revolving around the issue. Chief among these is the series-long arc in which Ruth and Anthony try to conceive a child non-sexually he, because his relationship with his naturally-conceived daughter has fallen into ruin, and she, because of an inability to sustain a meaningful romantic relationship with a man.\n\n\n\nCast:\nPeter Davison as Dr Webster \nTracy-Ann Oberman as Dr Anderson (Series 01)\nMatilda Ziegler as Dr Anderson (Series 02 &amp; 03)\nGeoffrey Whitehead as Prof Donaldson \n\n\n\nRigor Mortis - S01 - E01\nRigor Mortis - S01 - E02\nRigor Mortis - S01 - E03\nRigor Mortis - S01 - E04\nRigor Mortis - S01 - E05\nRigor Mortis - S01 - E06\n\nRigor Mortis - S02 - E01\nRigor Mortis - S02 - E02\nRigor Mortis - S02 - E03\nRigor Mortis - S02 - E04\nRigor Mortis - S02 - E05\nRigor Mortis - S02 - E06\n\nRigor Mortis - S03 - E01\nRigor Mortis - S03 - E02\nRigor Mortis - S03 - E03\nRigor Mortis - S03 - E04\nRigor Mortis - S03 - E05\nRigor Mortis - S03 - E06\n.\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8e4be3c8615d254efa3e5ba505eb02082327e99","amp;dn":"Rigor+Mortis+-+S01+to+03+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8e4be3c8615d254efa3e5ba505eb02082327e99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,228,190,60,134,21,210,84,239,163,229,186,80,94,176,32,130,50,126,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
