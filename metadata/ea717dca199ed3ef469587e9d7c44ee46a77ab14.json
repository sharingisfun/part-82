His father Jim Swan was a prizefighter and his older brother John Swan is also a rock singer. It was actually John who had encouraged and taught Jim how to sing as he wasn't really interested at the time. His career as both a solo performer and as the lead vocalist with the rock band Cold Chisel has made him one of the most popular and best-selling Australian music artists of all time. The combination of 14 Australian Top 40 albums for Cold Chisel and 13 charting solo albums, including nine No. 1s, gives Barnes the highest number of hit albums of any Australian artist\n\nBarnes released Rage and Ruin on 27 August 2010, his first album of original material since 2007. He has stated that the ideas for most of the lyrics and song themes came from a journal he kept during a period in his life (late 1990s to early 2000s) when he struggled with drug and alcohol addiction. Two singles have been released from the album: &quot;Before the Devil Knows You're Dead&quot; and &quot;God or Money&quot;. The album debuted at number 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart on September 5, 2010.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1 - God Or Money\n2 - Before The Devil Knows You're Dead\n3 - Letter From A Dead Heart\n4 - Stupid Heart\n5 - Adam Was Just a Man\n6 - I've Seen It All (Rage &amp; Ruin)\n7 - Can't Do It Again\n8 - Time Can Change\n9 - This Ain't The Day\n10 - Love Can Break The Hardest Heart\n11 - Turn It Around\n12 - Largs Pier Hotel\n\nLAME -v0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea717dca199ed3ef469587e9d7c44ee46a77ab14","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Barnes+-+Rage+And+Ruin+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea717dca199ed3ef469587e9d7c44ee46a77ab14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,113,125,202,25,158,211,239,70,149,135,233,215,196,78,228,106,119,171,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
