Not everyone can turn their impressions into three minute works of art that resonate with compelling truths. Erica Wheeler is one of the rare few who can. &quot;The Harvest&quot; is a work that should instantly propel Wheeler into the front ranks of contemporary new folk&quot; -The Berkshire Eagle \n\n\n&quot;The Harvest&quot; is a masterful synthesis of bluegrass and modern folk and a gem of an album. From the jubilant affirmation of Spirit Lake, to the wistful memory of Autumn, \n&quot;The Harvest&quot; resonates with uncluttered brilliance. \n\nThis Signature Sounds debut from Erica Wheeler propelled her into the forefront of the contemporary singer-songwriter movement in the mid 90's. Produced by grammy nominee Laurie Lewis, the CD draws from influences of folk, new country, bluegrass and blues. It features award winning California musicians including Darol Anger, Mike Marshall, Barbara Higbie and Todd Phillips. \n\nIt is considered Wheelers finest recording and has been her consistent best-seller. Considered her &quot;breakout&quot; release, &quot;The Harvest&quot; charted for five months on Gavin's \nAmericana chart with four weeks in the top ten. Shortly after the CD's release, Erica was interviewed for feature story on NPR's All Things Considered with Korva Colem\n\n 1. The Harvest 3:33    \n 2. Spirit Lake 3:18   \n 3.
