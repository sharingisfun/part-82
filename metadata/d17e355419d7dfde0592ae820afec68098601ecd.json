It was a deliberate point I was trying to make. Whereas rock and roll had created a generation gap, disco was bringing people together on an enormous scale. That's why I really wanted to make a simple, bland statement, which was, 'All we're talking about basically (is) pop music.\n\nThe single was released in the UK first, peaking at number 2 on 12 May 1979, unable to break Art Garfunkel's 6 week stint at number 1 with &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;. In August of that same year, it was released in America, where it eventually climbed all the way to number one on 3 November.\n\nAlong with Scott, other musicians who played on the track were his brother Julian Scott (on bass), then unknown keyboardist Wally Badarou, Canadian synthesiser programmer John Lewis (who died of AIDS in 1985) and Brigit Novik, the backing vocalist.\n\nThe single was bolstered by a promotional video that was well received in its day; the clip featured Scott as a DJ singing into a microphone from behind an exaggerated turntable setup, at times flanked by two female models who sang and danced in a robotic manner. One of the sight gags in the video depicted Brigit Novik dressed in blue who actually recorded the backup vocals which are then mimed by the models, something that seems to foreshadow a number of incidents that occurred much later in the music industry with groups such as Milli Vanilli, C&amp;C Music Factory, and Black Box.\n\nThe single's B-side, &quot;M Factor&quot;, was featured in two different versions. The original cut appeared on the first UK and European releases of the single, while a slightly remixed version appeared on the single released in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe image of the baby on &quot;Pop Muzik&quot;'s single disc pictures Robin Scott's daughter, named Berenice, actually a singer and piano/keyboard player and composer herself, and involved with his father's friend Phil Gould and Wally Badarou projects.\n\nThe subsequent full-length album New York ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ London ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Paris ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Munich was recorded in Montreux, Switzerland, at Queen's Mountain Studio, using their regular engineer David Richards, as well as Julian Scott, Wally Badarou (who would later work with Level 42 and Compass Point All Stars, among others) and Brigit Novik. Additional musicians on the album included drummer Phil Gould (later of Level 42), Gary Barnacle on saxophone and flute and (at the time) local Montreux resident David Bowie, who did occasional handclaps. The album was also released in the U.S. on Sire Records (with a different track listing / order) but it was not a commercial success.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d17e355419d7dfde0592ae820afec68098601ecd","amp;dn":"M+-+Pop+Muzik+%28Beat+Club%29+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d17e355419d7dfde0592ae820afec68098601ecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,126,53,84,25,215,223,222,5,146,174,130,10,254,198,128,152,96,30,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
