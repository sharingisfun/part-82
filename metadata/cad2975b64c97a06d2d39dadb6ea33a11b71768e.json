With  several |\n| experienced metalheads from other local  metalbands, a new and loud band was |\n| born in Alkmaar, North of Holland.                                           |\n|                                                                              |\n| Bloid means  'happy' in  dutch  dialect.  Happy name,  heavy music!  What is |\n| interesting about Bloid is that it is  not a typical metalband with an angry |\n| attitude.  Enjoy to play  music and having  fun is much  more important than |\n| creating an heavy image.  This attituce  has brought the  band a lot of gigs |\n| and created lots of goodwill with bookers and venues.                        |\n|                                                                              |\n| Bloid is Rijnes on bass and vocals,  Jeroen on guitar and vocals and Daan on |\n| drums. Watching Bloid live is fresh and heavy at the same time. Enthousiasm, |\n| energy  and power  are  just a  few  key words to  describe  the  Bloid live |\n| sensation: Metal at its best!                                                |\n|                                                                              |\n| Released ............ 2008                                                   |\n| Recorded ............
