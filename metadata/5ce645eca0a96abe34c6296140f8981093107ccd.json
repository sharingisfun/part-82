This also includes IE8 and slipstreamed\n WMP11 with all hotfixes.\n\n - Slimmed XP\n Same as above with WMP11 slipstreamed, but this has a few items\n removed, the only item that might be needed is Chinese, Japanese\n and Korean. The only other items removed are redundant items like\n the Windows XP &quot;Tour&quot;.\n\n - TinyXP\n This aims to remove only the big components in Windows. Its smaller\n size comes not from taking out items, but by simply not updating\n to IE8 or WMP11 and instead, updating the OS the same way to June\n 2010 but with IE6 and WMP9 like the original XP. You will only see\n one Windows Update appear for this on Windows Update - &quot;Internet\n Explorer 8&quot;\n\n - MicroXP\n This is, as usual, stripped right down to the bare OS almost. \n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n The Server 2003 versions are the same as above in terms of removed\n components, for example, Tiny2003 has the same items removed as\n TinyXP.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n All installations are &quot;typical&quot; installations in that you can access\n the Repair Option or Recovery Console - even the MicroXP and Micro2003\n versions are NOT unattended. This allows you to choose your keyboard\n and timezone etc as Windows installs. If you don't like this and want\n an unattended installation, no problem, just look in the ISO folder\n on the DVD and there you have 32 options for making a CD sized ISO file.\n\n Drivers are automatically included with all eight installations.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n To install Windows from this DVD, set your PC up so it will boot from\n the CD/DVD-ROM in the PC's BIOS.\n\n You do not need any product key for any of the installations.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n DRIVERS\n\n You have the following drivers in all 8 options:\n\n - Chipset --------&gt; (included by default)\n - CPU ------------&gt; (included by default)\n - Graphics -------&gt; (included by default)\n - LAN Ethernet ---&gt; (included by default)\n - SATA -----------&gt; (included by default)\n - Sound ----------&gt; (included by default)\n - Wireless LAN ---&gt; (included by default)\n\n When the PC reboots for the first time during installation (just after\n Windows files have copied) then you will see a driver selector pop up.\n\n If you do not catch this in time, or are not sat at the PC when this\n driver selector has timed out (after one minute) then all the drivers\n will extract - bear in mind, this will take a few gigabytes of disk\n space. If you do not want to extract the driverpacks, make sure you\n are sat at the PC after the files have copied and it reboots.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n APPS folder\n\n SILENT INSTALLERS:\n\n 7-Zip v4.65\n allSnap v1.33.2\n AutoIt v2.64\n Daemon Tools Lite v4.35\n DirectX 9c Feb 2010\n Everything v1.2.1.371\n Flash Player v10.0.45.2 (IE)\n FolderSizes v4.5.1.1\n Foxit PDF Reader Pro v3.0.1301\n GetDiz v4.4.0.2\n HashTab v3.0\n IMG Burn v2.5.0.0\n NET Framework v3.5\n Notepad2 v4.0.23\n Prio v1.9.9.2091\n Unlocker v1.8.8\n uTorrent v1.8.5.17414\n Visual C++ Runtimes 2005 2008\n VMware Workstation Lite v5.5.4 (Build 44386)\n WinRAR v3.91\n\n PORTABLE PROGRAMS:\n\n Agent Ransack v1.7.3.332\n ChromePlus v1.4.0.0\n Desksave v8.2.1\n DeVeDe v3.12.2\n Dir2Txt v1.0\n Duplicate File Finder v3.5\n DVDFab Platinum v6.2.1.8\n ExamDiff Pro v3.1.4.8\n Foobar2000 v1.0\n Google Earth v5.1.3506.3999b\n G Spot Codec Viewer v2.70a\n HandBrake v0.9.4\n Hex Workshop v6.0.1.4603\n Levelator v2.1.1\n Nero Micro v9.4.13.2\n Nicotine+ v1.2.10 With GTK+ v2.16.0\n Photoshop v11 CS4 Lite\n PowerArchiver 2010 v11.50.41\n Process Explorer v11.33\n Resource Hacker v3.4.0.79\n Shutdown Timer v1.0.3\n SMplayer v0.6.8.3392\n SoftMaker Office 2010 Rev 570\n SopCast 3.2.9 [SMplayer v0.6.9]\n Sound Forge v10.0a Build 425\n Startup Control Panel v2.8\n TCP View v2.54\n UltimateDefrag 2008 v2.0.0.55\n UltraISO v9.3.5.2716\n Unstoppable Copier v2.28\n Video MP3 Extractor v1.6.0.35\n Virtual DJ v5.2.1\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n ISO folder\n\n In the ISO folder you will see 32 batch files - these 32 files give\n you 32 separate options for building a sub-700Mb CD ISO file of a\n chosen option.\n\n You can choose XP or 2003, full, slimmed, Tiny or Micro but also, \n you can choose to include drivers (or not) and even make the CD\n install as an &quot;Unattended&quot; CD where no user input is needed in\n the Windows setup.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n REMOVED ITEMS\n\n You can see what items were removed by opening the &quot;Last Session.ini&quot;\n file that corresponds to the installation you want to check.\n\n All nLite &quot;Last Session&quot; files can be found in the relevant folders:\n\n Option 1 = XP01\\I386\\SVCPACK\\NLITE\\Last Session.ini\n Option 2 = XP02\\I386\\SVCPACK\\NLITE\\Last Session.ini\n Option 3 = XP03\\I386\\SVCPACK\\NLITE\\Last Session.ini\n Option 4 = XP04\\I386\\SVCPACK\\NLITE\\Last Session.ini\n\n Option 5 = WS01\\I386\\SVCPACK\\NLITE\\Last Session.ini\n Option 6 = WS02\\I386\\SVCPACK\\NLITE\\Last Session.ini\n Option 7 = WS03\\I386\\SVCPACK\\NLITE\\Last Session.ini\n Option 8 = WS04\\I386\\SVCPACK\\NLITE\\Last Session.ini\n\n (If using these files, nLite version 1.4.9.1 must be used)\n\n These files also list all the hotfixes slipstreamed with nLite.\n\n All other Windows Updates can be found in the &quot;WU&quot; folder of\n each &quot;????\\I386\\SVCPACK&quot; (where ???? is XP01 or XP02 etc)\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n eXPerience folder (Desktop) \n\n Most of these folders contain quick solutions to things that otherwise\n would be buried away in the Windows GUI, or require DOS style commands.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n Don't forget To Join The Forum @ SnipeR's Redemption Network:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://retestrak.nl/board/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://retestrak.nl/board/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n Enjoy this fine release from eXPerience \n\n Release Date : June 2010\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ce645eca0a96abe34c6296140f8981093107ccd","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+2003+Multi-Boot+DVD+x86+June+2010+-+eXPerience","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ce645eca0a96abe34c6296140f8981093107ccd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,230,69,236,160,169,106,190,52,198,41,97,64,248,152,16,147,16,124,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
