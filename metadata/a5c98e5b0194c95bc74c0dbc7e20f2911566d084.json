It began its broadcast on the channel BBC One on 20 September 2008. The series is based on the Arthurian legends of the mythical wizard Merlin and his relationship with Prince Arthur, but differs from traditional versions of the legend in many ways, especially the characters. It is produced by independent production company Shine Limited. After a successful first series, American broadcaster NBC began airing the programme on 21 June 2009, but after a decline in viewership, was moved to the cable network Syfy, where it began broadcast of the second series on 2 April 2010. The second series began airing on 19 September 2009 on BBC One. On 5 September 2010, BFI Southbank in London previewed the first two episodes of the third series for its September Film Funday programme.\n\nThe concept for Merlin was influenced by the American show, Smallville, about the early years of Superman. After many failed attempts to bring the programme to life, development of the current Merlin began in late 2006, with physical production beginning in March 2008. The series received generally mixed reception when it began its broadcast. Critics were upset with the flat dialogue and the modern look to the series. One critic, in particular, called the whole concept &quot;bland&quot;. The series premiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re drew an overnight average of 6.65 million viewers in the 19:00 slot, a final consolidated figure of 7.15 million, despite being scheduled against popular ITV series The X Factor. The first series as a whole had an average of 6.32 million viewers, which is fewer than Doctor Who attracted during its first series, and slightly more than those received by Robin Hood. Merlin was also the fifth most watched programme on BBC iPlayer in 2008. The third series of Merlin began on 11 September 2010.\n\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 349 MiB\nDuration                         : 42mn 20s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 151 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 42mn 20s\nBit rate                         : 1 010 Kbps\nWidth                            : 624 pixels\nHeight                           : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.184\nStream size                      : 306 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension    : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 42mn 20s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 38.9 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 460 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.90.\nEncoding settings                : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17.6 --abr 128\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5c98e5b0194c95bc74c0dbc7e20f2911566d084","amp;dn":"Merlin.2008.S03E02.WS.PDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5c98e5b0194c95bc74c0dbc7e20f2911566d084","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,201,142,91,1,148,201,91,199,76,13,188,126,32,242,145,21,102,208,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
