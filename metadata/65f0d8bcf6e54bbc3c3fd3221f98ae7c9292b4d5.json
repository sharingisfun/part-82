It has debuted at #34 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts for the week of August 14, 2010.\n\nThe music video, directed by Billy Zabka, was shot around Las Vegas, Nevada. David Arquette plays the man in the video who proposes to his girlfriend. Rick Harrison of the History Channel original show Pawn Stars  makes a cameo appearance in the video when the Flatts and Arquette stop at the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop to buy an engagement ring. There are also cameos by Ron White and Penn Jillette.\n\nMatt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the song a four-out-of-five rating, saying the lyrics &quot;may be 'cheesy' to some, but it fits right where we'd expect a Rascal Flatts song to go.&quot; Giving it a &quot;thumbs up,&quot; Jim Malec of American Twang thought that it was a return in sound to the band's earlier albums, also praising the &quot;great details and images&quot; of the lyrics as well as Gary LeVox's vocals.\n\nRascal Flatts is an American country music band founded in Columbus, Ohio. Since its inception, Rascal Flatts has been composed of three members: Gary LeVox (lead vocals), Jay DeMarcus (bass guitar, keyboards/piano, vocals), and JoeDon Rooney (lead guitar, vocals).
