Elmhurst's revealing book The World Hoax (1938) which is an outspoken examination of the Jewish role in Bolshevism after Red Russia's first twenty years. Covered in depth are the backgrounds of the major players: Karl Marx (aka Karl Heinrich Mordecai), Lenin (aka Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov), Trotsky (aka Laiber Davidovich Bronstein), Bela Kun (aka Benjamin Cohen), Stalin (aka Djugashvili, Ivanovich, Tchichikov, Koba, etc.) and Litvinoff (aka Meier Polyanski Finkelstein). The author attempts to tie Judaism and Communism together thus exposing not only the communist movement itself but also it's origins and aims at a new world order. The World Hoax is a rare expose, crammed with long neglected facts and checkable references. 215 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca24204e4cacb8c190a59d4c021405bebf9bdf9f","amp;dn":"Elmhurst+-+The+World+Hoax+%28jewish+role+in+bolshevism%29%281938%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca24204e4cacb8c190a59d4c021405bebf9bdf9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,36,32,78,76,172,184,193,144,165,157,76,2,20,5,190,191,155,223,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
