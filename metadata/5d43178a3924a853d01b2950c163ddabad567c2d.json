But when the three become unexpectedly trapped in 1940, they struggle not only to find their way home but to survive as HitlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bombers attempt to pummel London into submission.\n\nNow the situation has grown even more dire. Small discrepancies in the historical record seem to indicate that one or all of them have somehow affected the past, changing the outcome of the war. The belief that the past can be observed but never altered has always been a core belief of time-travel theoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but suddenly it seems that the theory is horribly, tragically wrong.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2060 Oxford, the historiansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ supervisor, Mr. Dunworthy, and seventeen-year-old Colin Templer, who nurses a powerful crush on Polly, are engaged in a frantic and seemingly impossible struggle of their ownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to find three missing needles in the haystack of history.\n\nTold with compassion, humor, and an artistry both uplifting and devastating, All Clear is more than just the triumphant culmination of the adventure that began with Blackout. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Connie WillisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most humane, heartfelt novel yetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a clear-eyed celebration of faith, love, and the quiet, ordinary acts of heroism and sacrifice too often overlooked by history.  \n\nenjoy\nabm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d43178a3924a853d01b2950c163ddabad567c2d","amp;dn":"Connie+Willis+-+All+Clear+64kbs+mp3+rkl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d43178a3924a853d01b2950c163ddabad567c2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,67,23,138,57,36,168,83,208,27,41,80,193,99,221,171,173,86,124,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
