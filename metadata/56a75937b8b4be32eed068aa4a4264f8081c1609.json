He did not say if then or since whether this was to be a permanent change.\n\nIt seemed today that even Alex himself was a little confused by the change.  At the end of the final [3rd] hour, he said: \n&quot;Coming up in the next hour I'm going to get into all the military take-over drills, Marines on the streets of L.A. This is mainstream news, MSNBC. That's coming up in the next hour.&quot;\n\nThat confused me a bit too, so I checked on the Prison Planet Forum and found an &quot;official&quot; posting there stating:\n&quot;Alex Goes Back to 3 Hour Weekday Shows Starting July 12, 2010 -- But ALL 3 hours will be televised live at www.PrisonPlanet.tv.&quot;\n\nPlease check my blog for a little further discussion of this.\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n\n\n\n\nScheduled Guests\n................\n\n[show description from the Infowars web site]\n\n\nAlex welcomes to the show author, businessman, financial commentator, economic adviser to Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign, and a 2010 candidate for the United States Senate, Peter Schiff. He is president and chief global strategist of Euro Pacific Capital Inc., a broker-dealer based in Westport, Connecticut. Schiff is the author of Crash Proof: How to Profit from the Coming Economic Collapse and How an Economy Grows and Why It Crashes. \n[hour from about 5:00 in hour 3, through the end of the hour]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.europac.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.europac.net&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.europac.net/media/video_blog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.europac.net/media/video_blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://schiffforsenate.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://schiffforsenate.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlex covers the latest news and takes calls.\n\n\n\n\n\n..........\n\nfolder.jpg courtesy of commenter &quot;Nighted&quot; at the sebaygo1 blog\n..........\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_torrents_info_PLEASE-READ.txt\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
