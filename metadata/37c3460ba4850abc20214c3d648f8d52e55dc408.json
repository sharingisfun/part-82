The journal has gained a worldwide reputation, demonstrated by its high ranking in the ISI Science Citation Index, as a forum for general and specialised communication between biophysicists working in different areas. The majority of reviews published are invited from authors who have made significant contributions to the field, who give critical, readable and sometimes controversial accounts of recent progress and problems in their speciality. Thematic issues are occasionally published.\n\n- journals.cambridge.org\n\nIssue 01:\npp. 1 - 39: From the globular to the fibrous state--protein structure and structural conversion in amyloid formation\npp. 41 - 106: 13C-NMR, MS and metabolic flux balancing in biotechnology research\n\nIssue 02:\npp. 107 - 144: Moving one DNA double helix through another by a type II DNA topoisomerase--the story of a simple molecular machine\npp. 145 - 237: Structure calculation of biological macromolecules from NMR data\n\nIssue 03:\npp. 239 - 295: The moving parts of voltage-gated ion channels\npp. 297 - 355: Trifluoroethanol and colleagues--cosolvents come of age.
