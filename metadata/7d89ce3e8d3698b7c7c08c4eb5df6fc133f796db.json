L. Doctorow's Ragtime rewritten by a mellower, comically more benevolent Thomas Pynchon and you might have a novel something like this one. Real peopleAlexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, William Randolph Hearstare involved in imagined events, and historical facts counterpoint fictional themes. Mourly Vold, a nearly blind student, discovers how to make free telephone connections and creates a communications network of blind people called the Party Line. Hearst, hearing of this, fears a conspiracy of Bolsheviks or Mexican anarchists, and enlists the aid of his old crony Edison in catching the dangerous miscreant. All is resolved in a broadly farcical (though perhaps too hurried) conclusion, with many chuckles along the way and some interesting speculations on the nature of scientific investigation. An intriguing and enjoyable romp by the author of McKay's Bees.\n\n- Charles Michaud, Turner Free Library","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d89ce3e8d3698b7c7c08c4eb5df6fc133f796db","amp;dn":"Loving+Little+Egypt+%28Thomas+McMahon%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d89ce3e8d3698b7c7c08c4eb5df6fc133f796db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,137,206,62,141,54,152,183,199,192,140,78,181,223,111,193,51,247,150,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
