Enhances the formula it cobbled together using a little Devil May Cry, a little Streets of Rage, and a far more impressive amount of movie footage from all three of the Peter Jackson films, Return of the King  expands in every single way to make this year's effort undeniable. Players get the chance to play as five characters (Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Sam and Frodo), plus three secret ones; the environments are interactive with useable weapons, ropes to swing down, catapults to fire, and more. Plus, gamers can finally get together with their buddies to play the game in co-op mode.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4991dd519c524f3badf9eaf49911e0e2ec01a01d","amp;dn":"The+Lord+Of+The+Rings%3A+The+Return+Of+The+King+%5BMAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4991dd519c524f3badf9eaf49911e0e2ec01a01d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,145,221,81,156,82,79,59,173,249,234,244,153,17,224,226,236,1,160,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
