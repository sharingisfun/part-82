The journal has gained a worldwide reputation, demonstrated by its high ranking in the ISI Science Citation Index, as a forum for general and specialised communication between biophysicists working in different areas. The majority of reviews published are invited from authors who have made significant contributions to the field, who give critical, readable and sometimes controversial accounts of recent progress and problems in their speciality. Thematic issues are occasionally published.\n\n- journals.cambridge.org\n\nIssue 01:\npp. 1 - 59: Noise in a minimal regulatory network--plasmid copy number control\npp. 61 - 104: Light at the end of the Ca2+-release channel tunnel--structures and mechanisms involved in ion translocation in ryanodine receptor channels\n\nIssue 02:\npp. 105 - 267: Intermolecular forces in biology\n\nIssue 03:\npp. 269 - 324: Role of DNA sequence in nucleosome stability and dynamics\npp. 325 - 472: Emerging issues of connexin channels--biophysics fills the gap\n\nIssue 04:\npp. 473 - 561: Simulation approaches to ion channel structureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“function relationships\npp. 563 - 679: Dynamics of biochemical and biophysical reactions--insight from computer simulations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acaf84cd4a368fbda57bfbafc7ef7825db1a6f72","amp;dn":"Quarterly+Review+of+Biophysics%2C+Volume+34","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acaf84cd4a368fbda57bfbafc7ef7825db1a6f72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,175,132,205,74,54,143,189,165,123,251,175,199,239,120,37,219,26,111,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
