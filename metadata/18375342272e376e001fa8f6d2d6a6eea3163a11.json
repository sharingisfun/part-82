Emerging from the Ladbroke Grove underground at the end of the 60s, the band trailed radicalism and counter-culture in their wake, and have been a direct influence on punk, metal, dance and rave. Includes interviews with some of the band's enduring legends, including bassist Lemmy, writer Michael Moorcock, founder members Terry Ollis, Nik Turner and Mick Slattery, and former managers Doug Smith and Jeff Dexter.\n\n\nBesides liking some of Hawkwinds music, I want to share this with CHub members as it tells a tale on another plane of existence where the Government was involved in distributing drugs to the public via music gigs, and the staging of a new terrorist movement by use of a deranged MKULTRA victim heading an influential UK/European music group of the 70-80's.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074tmc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074tmc&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18375342272e376e001fa8f6d2d6a6eea3163a11","amp;dn":"Hawkwind%2C+Do+Not+Panic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18375342272e376e001fa8f6d2d6a6eea3163a11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,55,83,66,39,46,55,110,0,31,168,246,210,214,166,238,163,22,58,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
