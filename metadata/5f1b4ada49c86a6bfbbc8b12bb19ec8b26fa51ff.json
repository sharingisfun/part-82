The first issue appeared in April 1991 and it has been irregularly published ever since. The comics are generally portrayals filled with lost, lonely characters searching for meaning, often reaching back into the past. They are known to be deeply affecting and almost indescribably weighty.\n\nThe series and its creator have won multiple industry awards, including the 1997 Ignatz Award for Outstanding Artist and for Outstanding Graphic Novel or Collection (for the It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken collection).\n\nIt's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken was originally published in issues four through nine of the comic book series Palooka-Ville.  The story follows Seth's search for a fictional Canadian cartoonist named Kalo, who once contributed to The New Yorker. The book was #52 on the list of the &quot;100 Best Comics of the 20th Century&quot; compiled by The Comics Journal.\n\n\nReleased on &lt;a href=&quot; http://ComicPirates.info&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://ComicPirates.info&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f1b4ada49c86a6bfbbc8b12bb19ec8b26fa51ff","amp;dn":"Palooka-Ville+%28Seth%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f1b4ada49c86a6bfbbc8b12bb19ec8b26fa51ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,27,74,218,73,200,106,107,251,188,139,18,187,25,236,139,38,250,81,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
