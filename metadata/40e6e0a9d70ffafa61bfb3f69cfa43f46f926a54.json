When you \nstart the program displays a list of your disks with the percentage of &quot;health&quot; \nremained, and their temperature. HDDlife can work in a preventative mode, \nregularly monitoring the &quot;health&quot; of hard drives and informing you of the \nresults of the audits. Warned about a possible hard drive failure, you will \nprotect yourself from data loss.\n\nHDDlife - worried about hard-drive failure? Get HDDLife - a real time hard drive \nmonitoring utility with alerts, malfunction protection and data loss prevention \nfunctions. This hard-drive inspector is an advanced proactive hard drive failure \ndetection system that controls 100 of hard-drive risks.\n\n\nFeatures:\n*********\nWarning control. \nThe regular and constant use of HDDlife will allow you to learn about possible \nhard drive failure beforehand and to prevent the loss of personal data.\n\nPreventative regular inspection. \nHDDlife can work in the background, checking and controlling the health of your \nhard drives and security of your data at regular intervals. It uses as little \nmemory and does not bother you with unnecessary messages.\n\nInformation on the free disk space. \nFull details on all sections of the hard drives - the name, file system, total \nsize, free (available) space.\n\nThermometer for your zhectkih drive. \nWith increasing temperature, the hard drive of only 10 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° C, its performance drops \nby almost 2 times! HDDlife allows you to solve this problem - the actual disk \ntemperature is always displayed in the system tray (near the clock).\n\nTime management works - how old is your hard drive?. \nThere are times when you need to know how the old hard drive is and how much time \nit actually worked? HDDlife gives you this opportunity! Now reflect the time spent \nin disk form years, months, days and hours!\n\nOffice of noise / performance disk. \nWith HDDlife, you can manually set the volume level of the disc. At the same time \nin quiet mode decreases performance, but as the tests, in the quiet mode, it drops \nby only 10-15%. But for some disks (eg, Maxtor) you can achieve almost silent \noperation!\n\nRemote monitoring and alarm systems. \nHDDlife allows you to control the pre-crash consisting of disk and the replacement \nof the hard drive before it fails. Network administrators can configure alerts \nabout dangerous state of hard disks. Messages may be sent via a computer network \n(analog net send ...) or by e-mail, making the remote control for any amount.\n\nHDDLife is S.M.A.R.T. technology based and works both for single PCs and large \ncomputer networks. S.M.A.R.T. technology was developed by hard-drive manufacturers\nto accurately predict hard-drive life span and prevent HDD malfunction.\n\n\nBenefits:\n*********\nHDDLife displays S.M.A.R.T. attributes real time and alerts system administrator \nif particular hard-drive's attributes exceed threshold values and being at risk.\n\nThe system administrator can then back data up and/or replace endangered hard-\ndrive. HDDLife loads on Windows start, compares new attribute values with the \nprevious values and consumes absolutely no memory.\n\nThe program is extremely straightforward no fundamental knowledge or PC or hard-\ndrive technology needed whatsoever. Zero failures during last four years for \n100000+ hard-drives monitored!\n\nJustNow! is a completely new technology that allows you to find out the state of \nhealth and performance rate of your hard drives immediately both when you start \nthe program for the first time and when you start it again!\n\nThere is no need to control disks over a long period of time! No analogous \nsoftware allows it! Thanks to this technology, HDDlife also shows the health \nand performance level in percentage as compared to a new disk.\n\nHDDlife can work in the background mode checking and controlling the health \nof your hard drives and the safety of your data at certain time intervals. \nAt the same time, it uses as little memory as possible and does not annoy \nyou with unnecessary messages.\n\nTo be able to work efficiently, you must know not only the health, but also \nthe performance rate of your hard drive. With HDDlife, you will be able to \nsee when it approaches the critical level and have time to replace your \nhard drive before it becomes too slow and paralyzes your work.\n\nModern computers emit a large amount of heat and use coolers to get rid of it. \nA hard drive is no exception: the faster it works, the hotter it gets. When the \ntemperature of a hard drive increases by 10% its performance rate gets two times \nless! That is why it is very important to control their temperature too. HDDlife \nallows you to solve this problem as well since the actual disk temperature is \nalways displayed in the system tray (next to the computer clock).\n\nAnother nice feature is that HDDlife can show you the highest temperature the \ndisk has reached for the entire period of its work (in case the disk supports \nthis feature). It will allow you to determine how the disk has been working so \nfar, whether it has ever been overheated before and whether it will have failures \nin the future.\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n********************\n- Windows 2000 / XP / Vista / 7\n\n\nMore info:\n********** &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://hddlife.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://hddlife.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n*** When using TPB please read these important notes: \n*****************************************************\n\n01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their \n    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my TPB account:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis torrent is scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security \n2- Avira AntiVir Premium \n3- avast! Pro Antivirus\n4- Kaspersky Antivirus\n\nAlso scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.\nMalware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at November 03, 2010 - 02.30 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40e6e0a9d70ffafa61bfb3f69cfa43f46f926a54","amp;dn":"HDDlife+Pro+3.1.170+%28Multilanguage%29+%2B+Crack+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40e6e0a9d70ffafa61bfb3f69cfa43f46f926a54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,230,224,169,215,15,250,250,97,191,179,246,156,250,67,244,111,146,106,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
