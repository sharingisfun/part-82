A firsthand look at the park's history. Ride along as Jason and the gang takes you on five of the top roller coasters in the country and get an inside view of many of the park's best attractions.\n\n\nI have found my original DVD that I made and I made a h.264/aac file in an MKV container. This is by no means a DVD quality video. It was recorded on VHS back in 1994 from an antenna signal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a1531be9c2fd76cacd463ee7703a5823b96e507","amp;dn":"Kings+Island+20th+Anniversary+Special","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a1531be9c2fd76cacd463ee7703a5823b96e507","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,21,49,190,156,47,215,108,172,212,99,238,119,3,165,130,59,150,229,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
