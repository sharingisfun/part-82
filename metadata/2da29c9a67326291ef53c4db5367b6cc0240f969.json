At    \n this time, Rio was the capital of\n the Republic, and he was elected congressman in various   \n legislatures, becoming one  \n of the most prominent defenders of abolitionist ideas\n and, ahead of his time, started  \n to raise environmental debates.  \n But what brings him greatest recognition was his\n anonymous work on behalf of the  \n needed. Being known lovingly as the ''Doctor of the  \n Poor''. \n Whether as a politician devoted to humanitarian causes or \n a physician known for  \n never denying relief to those who knocked on his door,    \n Bezerra de Menezes becomes  \n an important spiritual leader and remains alive in the    \n hearts of millions of Brazilians. A   \n life history marked by fraternal love and charity.   \n Bezerra is also known as the Brazilian.    \n    \n  \n    Downloaded from www .
