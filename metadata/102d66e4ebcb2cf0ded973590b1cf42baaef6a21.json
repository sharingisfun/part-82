A compilation of chip covers/remixes of The Knife Songs. For you who donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know The Knife, its an electronic music duo, Karin and Olof Dreijer,  from Gothenburg Sweden who has been around since the beginning of 2000 and has had quite an important influence on later Swedish electronic music. Its been on our mind to do this compilation for some time but we though of inviting some friends over to add some adversity to it.  Most of them have been seen here on Data Airlines before and the majority of them are from the demo scene.  We are very pleased to announce the comeback of Zalza (Rebels^Tequila) and Per Almered aka Excellence in Art (XiA) on the chip music scene since their music has been very important and inspiring for allot of us in the past. We would also like to re thank Fr0st from the amiga crew Tulou and pr0f / comic bakery for the cover-art. This release is free for you to listen to and spread on the Internet as much as you want and we hope you like it. \n\nData Airlines ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Knife (DATA013)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dataairlines.net/releases/data-airlines-the-knife-data013/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dataairlines.net/releases/data-airlines-the-knife-data013/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:102d66e4ebcb2cf0ded973590b1cf42baaef6a21","amp;dn":"Data_Airlines_-_The_Knife-%28DATA013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"102d66e4ebcb2cf0ded973590b1cf42baaef6a21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,45,102,228,235,203,44,240,222,217,115,89,11,28,244,43,170,239,106,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
