The new one is true\nBluray quality, while the older looks like upsized DVD. \nI treated it with my magic to create my enhanced quality edition, but in this case\nthere is very little to enhance, so it is just ordinary BDRIP.\n\nRegards to all encoders especially Big thanx to Atom, FLAWL3SS and FraMeSToR crew.\n\n1. UNFINISHED movies HAVE synchro problems. This is the nature of highly\ncompressed content. Also there seems to be a problem with Haali Media\nSplitter. If you are using Media Player Classic, please make sure you have\nenabled INTERNAL FILTER for MP4.\n2. Please COMMENT my work ONLY if you have actually seen it. If you LIKED this\nrelease - tell others about it. If you didnt,  leave a comment saying  why, so I can learn from your opinions and provide you with something better in the future .\n3. I can confirm that XBox360 will play it through WINDOWS media center extender.\nFor more info read this forum http://www.avforums.com/forums/streamers-network-media-players/1107552-what-xbox-360-like-media-extender.html\n4. My releases are different than anybodys else, so they SHOULD NOT be compared to\nany existing scene rules. I believe that if there are different rules for Telecine\nand for DVDRip, there should be also different set of rules for FASM QEBS releases. If The\nScene overregulates itself, prohibiting new ideas to come, it will soon\nbecome like our governments.\n5. If you like the movie, show your gratitude to the creators by going to cinema or buying\nBluray/DVD !\n6. These movies can be directly streamed through WWW using Adobe Flash Player\nversion 9 or higher.\n7. The name FASM was derived from assembler efficiency. When you write something\ndirectly in assembler,  it usually runs much faster and has smaller size,\nthan the same thing written in C, Java etc. It also means FAchman SoofMan\n- founders of FASM \n8. FASM Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer is  h264 compression method\noptimized directly for lowbitrate HD contents. It is constantly being improved,  each revision brings quality to a new level. Its efficiency over standard\nx264 encoding is explained by the same reasons as  XVID encodes are better than\nDIVX3.\n9. FASM recommends IMGBURN for burning those files into DVD.\n10.Any subtitles made for different releases, but taken from the same source\n(Bluray Rip) should also work with this release.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6dc2c9011e93c6ca0740f690685a95ffe9a9171","amp;dn":"GLADIATOR+EXTENDED+REMASTERED+QEBS+1080p-FASM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6dc2c9011e93c6ca0740f690685a95ffe9a9171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,220,44,144,17,233,60,108,160,116,15,105,6,133,169,95,254,154,145,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
