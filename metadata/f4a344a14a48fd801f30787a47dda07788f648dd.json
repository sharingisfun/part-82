Brown is the newest member and he's been around for more than seven\nyears -- and who knows and understands the value of everything, from circular\nrhythm and mantra-like compositional structures to the extended gift of free\nimprovisation within their own definition of the time/space continuum. Tenorman\nDavid S. Ware has released lots of different kinds of records in the past two\ndecades. But those he's issued in the 21st century have been the most\nsatisfying. His understanding of dynamic, force, color, and that rare thing that\nJohn Coltrane discovered and taught in finding a series of fluid modes that you\ndefined through your horn to play in and improvise through to the next one are\nin evidence here throughout. Matthew Shipp's communication of theme, idea and\nbridge of ideas throughout the gig -- but most eloquently displayed on the\nrelative simplicity that is the Alice Coltrane-like &quot;Ganesh Sound&quot; -- is\nmajestic, dignified and purposeful. The centerpiece of this set is the\nthree-part &quot;Renunciation Suite.&quot; While much of what takes place within it is\nfree-blowing, one can hear the wildly adventurous anchor that the rhythm section\n-- bassist William Parker and drummer Brown -- provide, particularly in those\nknotty and wily exchanges between Ware's horn, Shipp's piano, and Parker's\nbass. The time is out of the box, it stretches and strafes between Ware's\nintervallic exploration and Shipp's codified, open investigations into\ndissonance as harmonic interplay. But lest one think the rest of this date is\nsome free-blowing excursion into excess, think again. &quot;Mikuro's Blues&quot; is a\nmodal blues with a repetitive circular rhythm that sways, swaggers and strolls\nbefore it finds its way back into the reprise of &quot;Ganesh Sound.&quot; Shipp's\nclimbing and shimmering that middle register as Ware finds places to blow along\nevery chord cluster make the cymbal and tom work of Brown and Parker's thematic,\nas well as schematic, bass patterns carry more weight. It feels like an\nelongated introduction to a tune that's been taking place all along. The disc\ncloses on &quot;Saturnian&quot; which does not reflect Sun Ra so much as it does a sky's\near view of bebop, the blues, and even hard bop. Yes, but does so through the\nangles, twists, and kaleidoscopic twirls of Ware's soundworld. It stops, starts,\ntries on one aspect of the tradition, finishes with it, and breathes in another\nin its joyous three-minute-and-forty-three second sprint. For those who get\nWare, this is another essential title in his discography. For those who don't\nyet but are open, this may be the one to put you over the line and into his\ncamp. For those stalwart uptights who simply refuse to try, there's certainly\nsome freshly recorded slab of museum-piece jazz to keep you happy while you chew\nyour cud in the pasture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4a344a14a48fd801f30787a47dda07788f648dd","amp;dn":"David+S.+Ware+Quartet+-+Renunciation+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4a344a14a48fd801f30787a47dda07788f648dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,163,68,161,74,72,253,128,31,48,120,122,71,221,160,119,136,246,72,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
