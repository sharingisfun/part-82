When his father dies, it is up to Aaron, the oldest son, to organize the funeral and give the eulogy. The funeral takes place in his father's home and Aaron tries to put on an appropriate expression on his face to welcome his relatives, including his famous writer brother Ryan (Martin Lawrence), and his father's friends. But preserving a civil atmosphere will be a hard thing to do, especially, when from the very start, the undertaker makes a horrifying mistake. And Ryan wants to be the celebrity of the event without paying for anything. But those incidents are only minor compared to the information that Aaron and Ryan get from Frank (Peter Dinklage) the mysterious dwarf who is attending the funeral and nobody seems to know.\n\nVideo: ID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 26mn\nBit rate : 851 Kbps\nWidth : 700 pixels\nHeight : 320 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.2:1\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\n\nAudio: ID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 26mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 224 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\n\nDuration : 1:26\nLanguage : English\n\ncredit Xclusive666 BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:377f0a3da4b00fe6193d104979f8ddb0d81b638e","amp;dn":"Death+At+A+Funeral+2010+DVDRip+XviD+LKRG%5BExtraTorrent%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"377f0a3da4b00fe6193d104979f8ddb0d81b638e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,127,10,61,164,176,15,230,25,61,16,73,121,248,221,176,216,27,99,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
