This is the introduction to a large-scale RoadRunner Cable-Router exploit on the Ambit U10C019 CableModem.\n\nBasically, the default Cable Router that RoadRunner/TimeWarner gives to its customers by default:\n 1) Allows for remote login with user: admin, password: cableroot.\n 2) Allows remote access by default. (port 64623 for telnet, port 64680 for webui)\n\nDevices affected:\nAmbit U10C019 CableModem\nBoot code revision : 2.1.6d\nHardware revision : 4.10\nSoftware revision : 5.66.1026\nSoftware build time : Feb 26 2009 12:53:26\n\n\nExample for scanning the RoadRunner IP ranges:\nnmap -PN -T5 --open -p64623 -n -P0 --max-retries 0 --host-timeout 5s -iL rr.lst &gt;&gt; nmap.log; cat nmap.log | grep -B 3 open &gt; open.log\n\nContained in this archive contains:\n rr.lst - list of RoadRunner CIDR blocks.\n open-cleaned.txt - my initial scan of the ranges to see a rough estimate of number of affected devices.\n readme.txt - this file..\n\n\nThis hole appears to have been patched with a firmware update:\n\n$ telnet device.ip 64623\nTrying device.ip...\nConnected to device.ip.\nEscape character is '^]'.\nConnection closed by foreign host.\n\n$ curl -vvv 24.172.42.225:64680\n* About to connect() to device.ip port 64680 (#0)\n*   Trying device.ip... connected\n* Connected to device.ip (device.ip) port 64680 (#0)\n&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1\n&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.21.0 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.21.0 OpenSSL/1.0.0a zlib/1.2.5\n&gt; Host: device.ip:64680\n&gt; Accept: */*\n&gt; \n* Empty reply from server\n* Connection #0 to host device.ip left intact\ncurl: (52) Empty reply from server\n* Closing connection #0\n\n\nI use the phrase &quot;appears&quot;, as I am unsure. Michael O'Donnel at Road Runner, who is the Chief of Security (if I recall correctly), said he would work \non it. Later, I did not receive much more contact after the *8 weeks of time* after I contacted them. Recent attempts to contact Michael via leaving \na voicemail got no reply. (Maybe I shouldn't have been so polite in my disclosure to them?)\n\n\n\nKeep safe.\n--\nHarry Strongburg &lt;harry.fd at harry.lu&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:243bbf0a5c8b5fd2fe00a6494aaa23844a42cb23","amp;dn":"%5BFullDisclosure%5D+RoadRunner+Ambit+Remote+Access","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"243bbf0a5c8b5fd2fe00a6494aaa23844a42cb23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,59,191,10,92,139,95,210,254,0,166,73,74,170,35,132,74,66,203,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
