Michelle speaks her mind and makes no apologies for it. Taking a vow to stay true to herself, K. Michelle understands that part of being a noteworthy new artist isn't just possessing talent but having something to say. &quot;I'm the biggest advocate of being yourself,&quot; says Michelle, who considers music to be her therapy. &quot;People can believe in you all day long, but if you don't bring it to light or nourish it, it doesn't matter.&quot;\n\nEach song she writes is a soundtrack to a life that started in Memphis, TN. A life that lead to the title of her debut album, Pain Medicine, which will be released this Fall on Jive Records. &quot;Everything that I do is in this album,&quot; says Michelle. &quot;I sing about what I'm going through at the moment. For example, I don't have any love songs on the album because I'm not in love right now.&quot; K. Michelle doesn't take for granted the opportunity she has to show the world who she really isÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a fighter, a single mother, a true musician. &quot;[Pain Medicine] is my story. If I have this platform it has to be my story.&quot;\n\nThe decision to become a singer/songwriter wasn't an easy one for K. Michelle. Although she earned a musical scholarship to attend Florida A&amp;M University, she eventually switched her major to Biology and toyed with becoming a nurse. &quot;I didn't want to major in music,&quot; says the 24 year old. However, she never stopped singing. &quot;My whole time at college I played the piano and sang. I even won Miss FAMU.&quot; However, it wasn't until she graduated college that she decided to make music her main focus. For several months she toured Asia as a singer with Memphis orchestra Sound Fuzion. Upon her return to Memphis, she took an office job. That didn't last long. &quot;I got a job in sales. I sat in a cubicle all day. I'd walk around the office singing. That's when I realized that was not the life for me.&quot; Michelle created a Myspace page and within a week caught the attention of a production company in Atlanta. Seeing this as her big break, she moved to Atlanta with the goal of securing a record deal. But that didn't happen for another two years.\n\nThanks to a chance run in with ERIKA WRIGHT, Michelle got the big break she needed. During a trip to Jive's New York offices. K. Michelle wowed Jive executives and received a deal. &quot;God knew I needed a label that could understand me. &quot;Memphis is a rough city. I thank the city, because it toughened me so much.&quot; It's that toughness that pours out in her debut album Pain Medicine. On it, K. Michelle writes and co-produces every track, making her album very personal. &quot;I can't fake music. I sing about what I'm going through at that moment.&quot; The album's buzz single &quot;Self Made&quot; has turned into a surprise hit, striking a chord with women thanks to its call for self-empowerment.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3625d610ed83322865094fc5741997de3d5a200","amp;dn":"K.+Michelle+-+I+Just+Can%5C%27t+Do+This+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3625d610ed83322865094fc5741997de3d5a200","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,98,93,97,14,216,51,34,134,80,148,252,87,65,153,125,227,213,162,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
