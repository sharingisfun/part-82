The promo was shot by production \ncompany Squeak Pictures in Los Angeles in October 1999 and directed by Honey, \ni.e., the husband-and-wife directorial team of Laura Kelly and Nicholas Brooks. \nThe video which, among others, touches upon the exploitation of garment workers, \nparodies the popular late 90's Gap commercials directed by Pedro Romhanyi. These \nads featured attractive young people singing songs while against a white backdrop, \nwearing Gap clothing. The phrase &quot;everybody in denial&quot; (the 'denial' being Gap \nbrand leather, vests, etc) then flashes loudly across the screen.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_Radio&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_Radio&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 25.00fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Media Length: 00:03:37\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
