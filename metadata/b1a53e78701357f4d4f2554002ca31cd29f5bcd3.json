The emotional impact of this film is unique to any form of art. The story is about a young girl and her life..and the human drama that tragedy brings to life.The history of this girl is steeped in Opes Dei and her families connection to the church. The film is not and is not meant to be a commentary on this. This film is anything but anti spiritual or anti anything.I hope this film makes it into the international market in spite of its unique and powerful vision. The director Javier Fesser has truly made a stunning film. To me the impact of the film goes beyond entertainment. This is not a light film though it is a positive experience to view it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1a53e78701357f4d4f2554002ca31cd29f5bcd3","amp;dn":"Camino","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1a53e78701357f4d4f2554002ca31cd29f5bcd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,165,62,120,112,19,87,244,212,242,85,64,2,202,49,205,41,245,188,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
