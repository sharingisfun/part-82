Michael Musikantow's vocals are somewhat reminiscent of Jeff Buckley. The vocals combine well with the pedal steel and fiddle to give each song a rich texture of sound. Some great harmony vocals appear on &quot;Anti-Climactic Girl&quot; and &quot;Caliber Eyes.&quot;\n\nAt twenty-two minutes, this six-song EP gives a great taste of the band. Sure, I wish it were longer, but the band goes all out, bringing in five guests (vocalists and musicians) to help out on this well-crafted album. I don't know what else to say about this other than that I am really looking forward to a full-length release from this band.\n\n1. Lay it Down 3:51   \n2. I Won't Break Down 3:47  \n3.
