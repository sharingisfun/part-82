These artificial, toxic treats are then sold with the blessings of the Federal Trade Commission and Food and Drug Administration ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ government organizations charged with safeguarding the public good ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ laying the foundations for future disease and chronic ill-health for the consumer, and a guaranteed source of revenue for the medical and pharmaceutical sectors.\n\nKevin reveals the shocking truth of how drugs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which are being advertised directly to the consumer, pushing their use to an all-time high ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ are actually the cause of illness and disease climbing to near epidemic levels.\n\nAnd, though it sounds dire, Kevin offers a light in the darkness and directs the reader to scores and scores of alternative therapies, medical practices, philosophies and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ most importantly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ potential cures that help your body regain its natural state of health and vibrancy.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nKevin Trudeau is fast becoming the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s foremost consumer advocate. Adopting as both his business and personal mission statement a vow to &quot;positively impact the whole person,&quot; Kevin has been involved in a vast array of business enterprises that marketed or sold products that he personally used and believed in 100%. Having been personally responsible for over $2 billion in business world-wide, Kevin knows from personal experience how big business and government try to debunk individuals who promote products that could hurt the profits of the giant multinational corporations. Kevin spends most of his time spearheading a website that promotes education about natural healing therapies; and a website that exposes corporate and government abuse and corruption. Kevin is actively pursuing lawsuits against the individuals, corporations and government agencies that take advantage of the average consumer. He is also dedicated to the formation of various foundations to pursue these goals, and has donated much of his fortune for that purpose.\n\nOne more thing ...\n\nAlthough the above is the usual commercial description for this book, it is also fair to add that the author has been involved in several controversial affairs.
