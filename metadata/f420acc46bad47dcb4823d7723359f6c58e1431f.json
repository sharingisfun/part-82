The effect of his campaign, spurred by the concept of total war - the complete elimination of the Confederacy's strategic, economic, and psychological ability to wage war - was terrible for the civilian population and devastating for the South's army.\n\nPushing the entertainment and educational potential of television, this feature-length documentary - filmed on location in brilliant High Definition - breaks new ground in documentary presentation. This deeply immersive THE HISTORY CHANNELÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® production combines compelling narration with unmatched dramatic sequences that transport you to critical moments of the fateful campaign.\n\nAs much psychological profile as historical reconstruction, after experiencing SHERMAN'S MARCH you will know the man and understand what drove him to the edge of sanity and into the pantheon of history's greatest military strategists. Hear from Sherman himself, as well as from characters both major and minor from every side of the conflict, as they relate in their own words the epic events of 1865.\n\nThe swath of destruction cut by General Sherman's onslaught would have been visible from the Moon, but he believed any sacrifice was justified if it meant ending the bloodiest war in history. His campaign remains controversial to this day, and this magnificent documentary - as only programming from THE HISTORY CHANNELÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® can - contributes powerfully and vividly to the debate.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f420acc46bad47dcb4823d7723359f6c58e1431f","amp;dn":"Sherman%5C%27s+March+%282007+History+Channel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f420acc46bad47dcb4823d7723359f6c58e1431f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,32,172,196,107,173,71,220,180,130,61,119,35,53,159,108,88,225,67,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
