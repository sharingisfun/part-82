A small group of news reporters and their military escort set out to tell the truth about what's happening in the world, despite the government's efforts to take control of the media.\n\nREVIEW:\n\nIf my IMDb name doesn't say it, then I sure as hell can explain it. I love zombie movies, even the no budget stuff like Feeding the Masses. Now Masses with nothing spectacular, but one thing I will say is the story kept me interested from beginning to end. The only annoying part about the film, IMHO, was the commercials plugged throughout the film. I really felt they distracted from the story a lot. However, I think the group put forth a decent effort and pulled off a decent indie flick.\n\nJusta thought, but maybe you guys could re-edit the film and do some major toning down on the brightness. Aside from the massive video look it has potential once it is re-color corrected.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436301/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436301/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSCREENS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/3488/vlcsnap2010102917h03m58.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/3488/vlcsnap2010102917h03m58.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img294.imageshack.us/img294/9890/vlcsnap2010102917h07m44.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img294.imageshack.us/img294/9890/vlcsnap2010102917h07m44.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/8063/vlcsnap2010102917h10m44.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/8063/vlcsnap2010102917h10m44.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSEED AND ENJOY FOLKS!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf0aa6d11feca6df5af70499e9c3de6212f9931f","amp;dn":"Feeding+The+Masses+%282004%29+-+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf0aa6d11feca6df5af70499e9c3de6212f9931f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,10,166,209,31,236,166,223,90,247,4,153,233,195,222,98,18,249,147,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
