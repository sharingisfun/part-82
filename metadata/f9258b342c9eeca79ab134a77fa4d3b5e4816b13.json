Wayne Rogers is a used car dealer who handles the slide trombone; Jerry Matz is a clarinet teacher with an inflated view of his own talents; Daniel Nalbach, the drum-playing dentist and bachelor who lives with his ailing mother; Stan Lachow, a quiet bassist; Andrew Duncan, a corporate type who comes to life only when he pounds a keyboard; and real-life musician Warren Vache as a superb trumpeter who passed up a musical career to marry Susan Egbert, the daughter of a wealthy real estate magnate. Rogers learns about a two-week gig available at a Catskill Mountains resort and proposes they take the job to see if they can hack it as working musicians. When Lachow becomes hospitalized with cancer, the men recruit a genuine pro (played by the late Cleavon Little) to fill in. When the motley band reach the resort, musical dreams and reality collide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9258b342c9eeca79ab134a77fa4d3b5e4816b13","amp;dn":"The+Gig+%281985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9258b342c9eeca79ab134a77fa4d3b5e4816b13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,37,139,52,44,158,236,167,154,177,52,167,127,164,211,181,228,129,107,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
