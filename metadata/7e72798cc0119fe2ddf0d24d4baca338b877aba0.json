He described it as &quot;a laid-back single that finds Walker not only in fine voice but singing a solid country song about how you can read body language and social cues of a woman who has stepped out on a lonely relationship to test the waters.&quot;\n\n&quot;She Won't Be Lonely Long&quot; is a moderate up-tempo song, featuring accompaniment from electric guitar and piano. The song deals with a male narrator's fascination with a woman whose lover had just left her (i.e. &quot;the way she's dancin' and drinkin' Chill Patron.&quot;) He also plans to date the woman, stating that &quot;if she's lonely now, she won't be lonely long.&quot;\n\nShe Won't Be Lonely Long is the ninth studio album by American country music artist Clay Walker, and was released on June 8, 2010, via Curb Records.
