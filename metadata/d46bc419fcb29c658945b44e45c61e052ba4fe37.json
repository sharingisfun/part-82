The band categorizes their music as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢stoner popÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“.\n\nThe group was formed in 2004 by Steve Brooks (ex-Floor), Juan Montoya (ex-Floor, ex-Cavity, ex-Ed MatusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Struggle), Jonathan NuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ez and Rick Smith (who also played in the grindcore bands Shitstorm and Tyranny of Shaw, and the screamo band Tunes for Bears to Dance To). According to MTracks.com: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTheir music has a unique, hard-hitting sound that provokes a wide range of emotions, and they have a large fan base throughout the world.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ They have toured with Mogwai, Isis, Pelican, Black Cobra, Baroness, Jesu, The Sword, Stinking Lizaveta, Harvey Milk and Boris. Steve Brooks, however, has said that they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t consider themselves a metal band. In describing the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sound, Smith said in an interview: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTo me itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mostly a combination of everything we listen to collectively as a band. We take what we like from what we grew up on and use it as creatively as we can. I think the meshing of different sounds comes naturally just because we all have different musical backgrounds yet have a ton of common interests.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ In terms of touring, Brooks said Torche is getting more of a young crowd.\n\nOn April 8, 2008, the band released their second full-length, entitled Meanderthal. It was produced by Kurt Ballou (Converge, Genghis Tron). It was met with critical acclaim, including that from Decibel Magazine who ranked Meanderthal #1 on their list of the Top 40 Extreme Albums of 2008 as well as an 8.2/10 by Pitchfork Media. In an interview, Brooks said the band themselves came up with the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s concept in terms of artwork and packaging. Brooks has also said that in terms of writing material, the band focuses on what they like, rather than worrying about a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbacklashÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from their fans.\n\nIn late 2008 Juan Montoya left the band, a move credited to musical differences. Steve Brooks said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHe is an amazing guitarist, but we are just not on the same pageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ but Torche will still carry on as a 3 piece bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nTorche has fulfilled this statement by embarking on several tours, including one with the band dredg and another with a reunited Harvey Milk.\n\n\nCurrent line-up\nSteve Brooks - Guitar, Vocals (Floor)\nJon Nunez - Bass (Shitstorm, Adore Miridia)\nRick Smith - Drums (At a Distance, Tyranny of Shaw, Tunes for Bears to Dance to, Ulna, Adore Miridia, Shitstorm, Mehkago N.T.)\n\nGenre = Stoner / Sludge Metal\nFormat = mp3\nBit Rate = 192 kbps\nFile Size = 30.05 MB\n\nTracklist\n1.
