Since her\nself-titled released back in 2006 certified platinum, Taylor has gone on to\nbreak an array of records worldwide with subsequent releases. Her last record\n'Fearless' reached double platinum status in the US after its release and was\nthe year's biggest US debut for any female artist. With her new single 'Mine'\ndue for release on October 11th already garnering much attention, 'Speak Now'\nwill clearly be no exception to her success. Swift's lyrical efforts have often\nbeen described as 'autobiographical' therefore she chose to express full writing\ncredit for the new record alongside Nathan Chapman serving as co-producer.\n\nAlready, 'Mine' took the number 1 spot on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs Chart\njust four days after its release. With the historic debut of 'Mine', Taylor\njoins Mariah Carey as the only female artists in the history of the Billboard\nHot 100 Chart to debut more than one single in the Top 5 in a calendar year.\nTaylor is currently nominated for a 2010 MTV Video Music Award for Best Female\nVideo.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nInfo:\n\nLike it?
