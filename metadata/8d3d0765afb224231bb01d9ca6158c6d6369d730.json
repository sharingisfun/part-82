JAPAN'S ATOMIC BOMB shatters that view.\n\nUsing once-secret Japanese wartime documents, this special offers evidence that Japan had world-class nuclear physicists, access to uranium ore, and cyclotrons to process it. They devised an innovative way to deliver the bombs using 400-foot long Sen Toku submarines, capable of carrying and launching airplanes. Most startling, just six days after Hiroshima, Japan tested its own atomic device on a small island 20 miles off the Korean coast! The sobering conclusion is that Japan may have been just weeks behind the U.S. in the race for the bomb.\n\nFile Size ------- 348mb\nLength ---------- 45:20\nResolution ------ 720x480\nContainer ------- avi\nVideo Codec ----- h264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 24\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d3d0765afb224231bb01d9ca6158c6d6369d730","amp;dn":"Military+Channel%3A+Japan%5C%27s+Atomic+Bomb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d3d0765afb224231bb01d9ca6158c6d6369d730","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,61,7,101,175,178,36,35,27,176,29,156,166,21,140,109,99,105,215,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
