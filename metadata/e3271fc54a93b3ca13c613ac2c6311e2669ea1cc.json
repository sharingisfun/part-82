He has produced for many other artists over the years, from Canada to Europe. His homemade beatz and mixing alongside catchy soulful hooks and lyrically complex verses have &quot;Wowed&quot; other artists and executives in the studio. Lyrically creative which helps his beatz jump off the stages! Started off in Toronto towards our very own E-town and now has created a buzz in the Vancouver hip hop scene. The future is bright for Bmoney. This is the year I believe he really has found his studio perfection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3271fc54a93b3ca13c613ac2c6311e2669ea1cc","amp;dn":"BMoney+Grenier+-+Fake+Recordz+%28HQ%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3271fc54a93b3ca13c613ac2c6311e2669ea1cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,39,31,197,74,147,179,202,19,198,19,172,44,99,17,226,102,158,161,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
