Suddenly a project concerning voracious beetles intended to control an addictive plant they hardly deemed worthy half a minute suddenly turns dangerous: once fed a bit of meat, they prove unstoppable carnivores, escape and cause the base to be automatically quarantined, and later even to self-destruct - the surviving humans are surrounded, without means of communication, so earth will presume them dead and according to standard-protocol must launch a neuro-toxin to eradicate all life on the planet... \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Season 9, Episode 18: Arthur's Mantle\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½24 February 2006\nWhen Samantha finally manages to start a device made by Merlin, it unfortunately renders her and colonel Mitchell invisible by transporting them to a parallel dimension.

Meanwhile on earth, the Russians announce they won't prolong the treaty to lend the Stargate to the US, but start their own program, but general Landry guesses right that's only to press another demand... Vala continues the village's apparently dictatorial leader is actually the head of the resistance, which plans to sabotage the whole Ori-war effort, but overhears a prior tell Tomin he's infertile... \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Season 9, Episode 20: Camelot\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½10 March 2006\nSince the weapon Merlin once devised against ascended beings seems the human race's best change to resist or even defeat the Ori, SG-1 travels by stargate to a medieval society in a place called Camelot where the local Arthur epic (differerent from earth's romanticized traditions) confirms its location should be found in a forbidden library guarded by a Black knight. When they are beamed up to earth's super-star-ships about to try stopping the Ori-fleet passing a super-gate, Daniel and colonel Mitchell decide to have themselves beamed back inside the library, but on neither front things go as expected... \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18cacf2540d95672a9298c89001a4baf44aee077","amp;dn":"STARGATE.SG-1.S09E17-20.SWESUB.+-Lindoff.ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18cacf2540d95672a9298c89001a4baf44aee077","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,202,207,37,64,217,86,114,169,41,140,137,0,26,75,175,68,174,224,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
