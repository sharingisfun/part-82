At their best -- &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart,&quot; &quot;You're in a Bad Way,&quot; &quot;Join Our Club,&quot; &quot;Who Do You Think You Are,&quot; among others -- they found the heart in nightclubbing. \nThe quality of the music dips slightly in the latter half of the album, but there is prime pop throughout the disc.
