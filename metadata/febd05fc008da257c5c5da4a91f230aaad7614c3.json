A Swedish Love Story brims with pop melodies, sweeping strings and joyous emotion. From the opening trackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s propulsive rhythm and soaring vocals, to the taut and energetic strings of &quot;Scandal at the parkade&quot;, into the gorgeous and epic closer &quot;DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop&quot;, the A Swedish Love Story EP is a stunning mini-masterpiece.\n\nA Swedish Love Story will be released on 10&quot; and digital on the 27th of September. It's available for pre-order now from the Domino Mart.\n\nHere's the tracklist:\n01. A man with no ankles\n02. Scandal at the parkade\n03. Honour the dead, or else\n04. DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop\n\n\n\n\nHere's what Owen has to say about A Swedish Love Story:\nTo contrast Heartland's convoluted record process, and also to cut myself a break, I recorded this EP in New York City over a week, using not much more than my violin, my Moog, a bass and a drum kit. It's closer in sound to my first album Has A Good Home than anything else. It's called A Swedish Love Story in tribute to one of my favourite films En Karlekshistoria and as a love letter to the Swedish pop stars who inspired it. This is probably the most posi record I'll ever make, enjoy the mood while it lasts.\n\n-- From Domino Records","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:febd05fc008da257c5c5da4a91f230aaad7614c3","amp;dn":"Owen+Pallett+-+A+Swedish+Love+Story+%282010%29+%28EP%29+%28V0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"febd05fc008da257c5c5da4a91f230aaad7614c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,189,5,252,0,141,162,87,197,197,218,74,145,242,48,170,173,118,20,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
