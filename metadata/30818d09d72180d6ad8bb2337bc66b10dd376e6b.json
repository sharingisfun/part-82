He is a member of Broken Social Scene but also tours on his own, having released four solo CDs. His latest album, Rat a Tat Tat, was released in March, 2010. He recently joined forces with fellow Canadians in an independently produced film project the Iodine movie where he accomplished his acting debut as Deputy Peel.\n\nBorn in Bramalea, Ontario, a Greater Toronto Area suburb, Collett began writing songs at a young age to escape the boredom of his suburban life. He lists Bob Dylan, Kris Kristofferson and Nick Lowe as influences. Eventually Collett moved to downtown Toronto where he worked as a woodworker and carpenter, doing renovations and custom home building, while he pursued his music. He was a part of the short-lived alt-country group Bird, of which Andrew Cash and Hawksley Workman were also members. Bird released one album, 2000ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Chrome Reflection. Collett also took part in TorontoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s popular indie music gathering, Radio Mondays. Collett, along with others such as The Weakerthans and artists on the record label Arts &amp; Crafts, would perform and write songs together. Collett has mentioned how Radio Mondays were great community-building events, with five or six artists on stage at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of Canada\\'s most revered songwriters, Jason Collett, will share yet another aspect of his immense musical talent, releasing \\&quot;Pony Tricks,\\&quot; a reworked acoustic collection of eleven songs, including two never-before released tracks, October 12 on Arts &amp; Crafts.\n\nWhat was originally intended as an EP of re-imagined Collett songs stripped to their core, quickly snowballed into a powerful 38 minutes of music that simultaneously exposes and celebrates Collett\\'s solo prowess and the intrinsic storytelling that makes his songs so unforgettable.\n\nCoinciding with the release of \\&quot;Pony Tricks,\\&quot; Collett will head out on The Undressed Tour, a true cross Canada run of solo acoustic dates that kicks off in Peterborough on October 14, touches both coasts and includes Collett\\'s first ever show in Newfoundland.\n\n\\&quot;Fans often ask me if I have recordings that are representative of my solo shows,\\&quot; Collett explains of the inspiration for \\&quot;Pony Tricks.\\&quot; \\&quot;This release simply aims to satisfy that demand.\\&quot;\n\nPony Tricks was recorded at Zeus\\' Ill Eagle Studios in Toronto, produced by Mike O\\'Brien and Carlin Nicholson and mixed by Robbie Lackritz (Feist). &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pluginmusic.com/news/article/jason-collett-readies-pony-tricks-with-two-previously-unreleased-tracks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pluginmusic.com/news/article/jason-collett-readies-pony-tricks-with-two-previously-unreleased-tracks&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nIndie rock darling Jason Collett first made his name in the Canadian music scene as a member of the multi-membered experimental outfit Broken Social Scene.
