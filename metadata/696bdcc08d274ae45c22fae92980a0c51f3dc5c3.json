It's really pure folk with some astounding guitar work, some handclapping, crackling wood noises, flamenco flavorings, and some eerie male vocals tastefully laid throughout.\nThe feeling of some songs are foreboding and dark, while others sound like the drinking music of past ages. Either way, this album is great for both active listening and background music, and also acceptable fare for both metal and folk fans.\nget it.\nbe sure to check out his other project &quot;thayer tavern&quot; on his friends list , good shit, this time with lyrics.\n- Cordyceps Zombie Swarm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:696bdcc08d274ae45c22fae92980a0c51f3dc5c3","amp;dn":"Thayer+Cabin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"696bdcc08d274ae45c22fae92980a0c51f3dc5c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,107,220,192,141,39,74,228,92,34,250,233,41,128,160,197,31,61,197,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
