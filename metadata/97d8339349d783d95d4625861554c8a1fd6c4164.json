From Windermere to Derwentwater, Coniston to Ullswater, sixteen lakes give this district its name. This new series, presented by Rory McGrath, looks at life in one of BritainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s favourite holiday destinations during a busy summer and the characters who inhabit it.\n\nIn this first episode we meet a woman running against time to have her new business open in time for the summer season, a local hotel manager aiming to swim across EnglandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s biggest lake, and witness an unusual proposal in a hot air balloon.\n\nThe characters weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll meet as the summer unfolds include the delightfully eccentric Patrick Gordon Duff Pennington who hosts lunches for foreign visitors at the ancestral family castle, Muncaster; Lakeland farmer, George Taylor, whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s won so many rosettes with his prize-winning eggs, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s made it into the Guinness book of records; The Barrister turned farmer, Thomas Ballentyne Dyke and his wife Lynne who have combined one of the lakes oldest traditions, farming, with one of itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s newest, tourism and opened up the farm to the public; And the Lake Wardens whose job it is to patrol one of the most beautiful lakes in the land, Windermere.
