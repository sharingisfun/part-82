No one \n        is able to speak; the film contains no dialogue, and characters \n        communicate non-verbally. \n                                                                           \n        In the near future, a global disaster has left the world on the \n        verge of collapse. The sky rains fish; skyscrapers lie buried in \n        mountains of sand; and the few remaining humans are unable to talk, \n        \\shuffling through the wasteland searching for food, shelter and \n        a glimpse of humanity. The Man longs for female companionship, so \n        he cobbles together a serviceable plane and takes off for the city, \n        where survivors shelter in the bodies of burnt-out cars. Here, The \n        Man finds himself in a bitter batter against the vengeful and murderous \n        Brute.
