Last night on Sean HannityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s show she said she is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnot going to do any more national media.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ She claims she only appeared on Hannity because she ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhad some business in New York.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that mean? That she figured out she could get her campaign to pay for free trip to New York for her if she went on the show? Christine claims sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not doing any more national media so that she can ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfocus on the people of Delaware.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ More specifically, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to focus on that roughly 30 percent who are dumb enough to vote for her.\n\nIn reference to witchcraft, OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Donnell repeated her ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWho didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do some questionable things in high school?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ line. That depends, Christine. Are we talking about sneaking a cigarette behind the gym, or worshipping Satan? In my school, not a lot of kids went through the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSatanic picnicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ phase. Sure, there was the black lipstick crowd, listening to Bauhaus on their Walkmans. But actual Satanic alters with actual Satanic picnic basketsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ not so much. OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Donnell said that her dabbling in witchcraft was, quote, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrebellion.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ What? Staying out past curfew isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t good enough for you? You have to worship the Devil? I went through my rebellious phase. It involved spiky hair and a lot of bracelets. I wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t standing on a pentagram trying to summon the Anti-Christ.\n\nBut Christine isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the only nut in the campaign trail mix. A new poll shows Andrew Cuomo with just a 6-point lead over Carl Paladino in the race for Governor of New York. Oh. My. God. Carl Paladino should not be within 6 points in a poll for governor. Carl Paladino should not be within 6 miles of the governorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s office. They really should come up with some kind of restraining order, just to be safe. In the poll, 40 percent of New Yorkers say the most important trait in a candidate is that heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbring change.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Carl Paladino will certainly bring change. But then so would a giant asteroid striking the earth. Governor Carl Paladino would be a disaster on a level with an asteroid strike or a tsunami. If he gets elected, New York State should become eligible for federal disaster reliefÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ assuming such a thing still exists if Senator Christine OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Donnell has her way.
