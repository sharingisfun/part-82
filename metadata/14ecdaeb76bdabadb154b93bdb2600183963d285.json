Not true!  For those of you who liked what I did with my first four albums, here are those albums PLUS two new albums!  Both albums contain some material from the Sneak Preview Album, and both albums also contain new material, as well!  Also included are the nearly-original track listings and notes on each album and track. I\\'m getting lazy in my old age!  *LOL*\n\nSorry about the year in between albums.  Things have been really up in the air for me during the past year.  Hopefully with my life taking a turn for the much better, I will have another one out a little sooner.  :o)\n\nAnyway, I won\\'t bore you with anymore drivel about what\\'s going on with me.  I\\'ll just put the contents of each album below and hope you enjoy the old and the new of my Altered Tunes!  :o)\n\n\n________________________________________\n\n\n\nThis is the first mashup album from Ty DeBole\\'s Altered Tunes. It features Michael Jackson\\'s Black Or White (acapella version) on every track, be it just the noises he makes or a full-blown vocal mashup. The resulting tracks vary from so-so to great, but all of them are funny! (With the exception of the unknown artist on track 02. No MJ, just music on that one.) The resulting album title is:\n\n2009-01-22  Michael Jackson Tunes\n\nThe track list is as follows:\n\n\n01 David Bowie vs. The Ventures vs. Michael Jackson - It\\'s No Game vs. Percolator vs. Black Or White (acapella)\n\nThis track includes just the noises MJ makes while singing Black Or White...FUNNY STUFF! Also, sounds are forward and backward! *LOL*\n\nResulting song title: Ventures Jackson - Black Or Percolator\n\n\n02 Unknown - This track was originally 32 music loops from within the Jackpot Matchup PC game, so it\\'s probably more of a remix than a mashup. Instrumental only. Maybe a vocal will be made out of it later! :o)\n\nResulting song title: Unknown - Jackpot Mashup Matchup\n\n\n03 Ace Frehley vs. Michael Jackson - New York Groove vs. Black Or White (acapella)\n\nThis track also includes just the MJ noises from Black Or White. The intro is great on this one! *LOL* Also listen for an MJ \\&quot;ahhhh\\&quot; that has been chopped and pitch adjusted to the \\&quot;ooooh\\&quot; of the actual Ace Frehley band! As MJ says at that point, \\&quot;This is the best part!\\&quot;\n\nResulting song title: Ace Jackson - Black In The New York White\n\n\n04 Gary Glitter vs. Michael Jackson - Rock &amp; Roll, Part 1 vs. Black Or White (acapella)\n\nOh, boy... Now we\\'re getting into layering the sounds... Just the MJ noises again, only layered. Not only does MJ make the noises in this one, but he doubles as the percussion! *LOL*\n\nResulting song title: Gary Jackson Glitter - Rock &amp; White, Part 1\n\n\n05 Gary Glitter vs. Michael Jackson - Rock &amp; Roll, Part 2 vs. Black Or White (acapella)\n\nOkay now, THIS track was a PAIN! It may not be finished completely, but it\\'s as finished as it\\'s going to get for a while. This track must have about 50+ hours worth of work into it! It\\'s also the first track where MJ actually SINGS Black Or White, makes the noises AND doubles as the percussion, as in Part 1, only different! *LOL* If you can get past some of the timing issues, this track is definitely worth a listen!\n\nResulting song title: Gary Jackson Glitter - Rock &amp; White, Part 2\n\n\n\f\n06 Midnight Oil vs. Michael Jackson - Beds Are Burning vs. Black Or White (acapella)\n\nOkay, NOW we\\'re talking the GOOD stuff here! MJ noises again, a little bit of vocal resulting in a really DECENT mashup! This is the next-to-the-best mashup in this series yet!\n\nResulting song title: Midnight Jackson - Beds Are Black Or White\n\n\n07 Midnight Oil vs. Michael Jackson - Beds Are Burning (Tamarama Mix) vs. Black Or White (acapella)\n\nHere it is...THE best mashup Ty DeBole\\'s Altered Tunes has made yet! This track is almost twice as long as the original with LOTS of instrumental passages, making more room for...you guessed it...more MJ vocal! :o) MJ actually sings the trailing 5+ verses of Black Or White in this one...TWICE! The reason for 5+ instead of 6 was because the music changed during the 6th verse, so it chops off and goes from there! *LOL* \\&quot;This IS the best part,\\&quot; as MJ says in the opening moments of the track! It also contains the usual noises from MJ. Funny AND a great track! :o)\n\nResulting song title: Midnight Jackson - Beds Are Black Or White (Tamarama Mix)\n\n08 Tone Loc vs. Spike Jones vs. Michael Jackson - Funky Cold Medina vs. Mr. Banjo vs. Black Or White (acapella)\n\nNow it\\'s getting a little weird...reaching back into the days of early comedy bands, putting a rap beat to it and mixing it up with MJ noises! *LOL* The only thing different about this Spike Jones track is, it\\'s an instrumental! Also notice that there are THREE bands involved in this mashup. It\\'s the entire Mr. Banjo repeated in a couple of places to make a longer track out of it, the drum beat from Funky Cold Medina, and the Usual MJ noises (very little singing this time). Also, before the silence that I created in the middle of the track, is a pitch-adjusted banjo lead-out, which sounds like it was actually originally recorded that way! It\\'s also the first track to fade at the end, instead of just chopping off with a \\&quot;Cut! That was perfect\\&quot; at the end. This whole track was \\&quot;the best part!\\&quot; *LOL* It\\'s also the last finished track of the MJ Tunes...\n\nResulting song title: Spike Michael Tone Jones - Funky Mr. Cold Black Or White Banjo (No Tone Mix)\n\n\nNow we get into the \\&quot;bootleg\\&quot; tracks. These tracks were considered to be finished at the time, but were improved upon later, so they became \\&quot;demo versions\\&quot;. These tracks are only included to show the steps taken on some of the tracks to their final end. The \\&quot;finished\\&quot; tracks are numbered, as you have seen above. The following \\&quot;demo\\&quot; tracks are lettered, and listed as follows below:\n\n09 (A) - The Ventures vs. Michael Jackson - Percolator vs. Black Or White (acapella)\n\nFirst off, notice there is no David Bowie intro in this one. Secondly, this track just sucks compared to the \\&quot;finished\\&quot; one. Well, what do you want from the very first try at making a mashup? *LOL* The only noises MJ makes in this one is \\&quot;ow\\&quot;. *YAWN*\n\nResulting song title: Ventures Jackson - Black Or Percolator (Demo)\n\n\n10 (B) - Unknown - Same song, same game, only the percussion has gone missing! I lost track of the percussion loops, so ended up with this so-so version. It even sounds like a different song. Oh, well, at least it sounds good in the number section... *LOL*\n\nResulting song title: Unknown - Jackpot Mashup Matchup (Demo)\n\n\n\n11 (C) - Gary Glitter vs. Michael Jackson - Rock &amp; Roll, Part 2 vs. Black Or White (acapella)\n\nThis is the saddest track in the set. Nothing came together in it here. Until it was improved, I was going to scrap it completely. You will be able to see why when you listen... *YUCK*\n\nResulting song title: Gary Jackson Glitter - Rock And White, Part 2 (Demo 1)\n\n\n12 (D) - Midnight Oil vs. Michael Jackson - Beds Are Burning (Tamarama Mix) vs. Black Or White (acapella)\n\nSame great song as track 07 above, only the vocal isn\\'t as complex... For one of the demos, it\\'s one of the two best! :o)\n\nResulting song title: Midnight Jackson - Beds Are Black Or White (Tamarama Mix, Take 1)\n\n\n13 (E) - Gary Glitter vs. Michael Jackson - Rock &amp; Roll, Part 2 vs. Black Or White (acapella)\n\nWell, this one is a bit better than the first demo... In fact it\\'s almost as good as the \\&quot;finished\\&quot; one! A number of timing flaws have been addressed here! :o) It\\'s still not quite there yet... Oh, well, maybe another album...\n\nResulting song title: Gary Jackson Glitter - Rock &amp; White, Part 2 (Demo 2)\n\n\n14 (F) - Tone Loc vs. Spike Jones vs. Michael Jackson - Funky Cold Medina vs. Mr. Banjo vs. Black Or White (acapella)\n\nThis was an experiment with two vocals in one song. It sounds a bit cluttered with both vocal parts in it, so it was changed to the track 08 above. This track is also the basis for the third track of my second album, which is in progress as of this time (01-29-2009)! :o)\n\nResulting song title: Spike Michael Tone Jones - Funky Mr. Cold Black Or White Banjo (Experimental Tone Mix)\n\n\n\nThat\\'s it for this album from Ty DeBole\\'s Altered Tunes. It was all started on August 13, 2008, with the demo version of Black Or Percolator. I hope that you will have as much fun listening to this album as I had making it! Let\\'s see how well this album does... The second one can only be better! :o) Thanks for listening!\n\n________________________________________\n\n\nThis is the second album from Ty DeBoleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Altered Tunes. It features Tone LocÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Funky Cold Medina on each track, whether itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a full vocal or just the percussion with Tone saying, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI dig it!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and a few other words thrown in. These tracks are kind of like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcheaters,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ because of the fact that more than one song is made from most of the tracks created here. One track led to an idea for another track! There are not as many demos in this one because I did a much better job the first time around, so they are almost all ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfinishedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tracks, except for four of them. Also, I had to deal with several of my work buddies and their complaining about there being no MJ in this album. I heaved a huge sigh and said that I would see what I could do about getting MJ into as many tracks as possible. This will end up being two albums of the same material, only different. I just want to see if I should continue using MJ as my trademark, or if I should just move on. My main concern is that YOU like the resulting songs. YOU are the reason I put so much time into this stuff. Sure, being a form of bootleg music, I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sell it, but my only payment is the fact that you like what I do. That makes it all worth it to me, so let me know!

Just add ty_deboles_altered_tunes to your Yahoo Messenger! :o) The resulting album title for this set is:\n\n2009-02-17  Funky Altered Medina\n\nThe track list is as follows:\n\n\n01 Butthole Surfers vs. Tone Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Naked Man vs. Funky Cold Medina\n\nThe album opener was a challenge set to me by a co-worker to make a country-rap song. This tune is pretty funny because of the fact that the song changes tempo many times throughout. It has what I call a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œquad intro,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or four intros made into one. It features the intro only from Funky Cold Medina, then slows to the tempo of the intro only from Naked Man, then a slowed Funky Cold Medina is added to the already-playing Naked Man, the tempo picks back up to the original Funky Cold Medina speed and a sped-up Naked Man intro comes into playÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦it goes from there! *LOL* For a first take, I think this track is a keeper! :o)\n\nResulting song title: Butt-Tone Surfers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Naked Cold Medina\n\n\n\n02 Butthole Surfers vs. Tone Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Naked Man (sped up) vs. Funky Cold Medina (percussion)\n\nHmmmmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Same line-up here, eh? Same songs, looks the same with the exception of whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in the parentheses at the end of the titleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦THATÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S the clincher! It is a completely different mix from the first one! ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all played at the same speed throughout the song. The funny part here is, Funky Cold MedinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s percussion is the only part of the song present, and Naked Man has been sped up to match the rap beat! *LOL* Very interesting listening, especially if you have heard the original tempo of Naked Man, which you have in the previous track! :o)\n\nResulting song title: Butt-Tone Surfers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Naked Cold Medina (Medina Speed Mix)\n\n\n\n03 Spike Jones vs. Tone Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mr. Banjo vs. Funky Cold Medina\n\nThis tune has a weird background. It was originally intended for this album, but I needed just one more track for the Michael Jackson Tunes album. The original version of this song can be heard as this albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first demo track, then this version was made for this album, then this same track just had some MJ sounds mixed in for the final demo track of the MJ Tunes album, but it sounded too cluttered, so Tone LocÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocal was removed and MJ was remixed a bit, and the MJ albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s final track turned out a lot different than this one! *WHEW* *LOL* Anyway, the Tone Loc vocal in this one is pretty funny stuff for the first couple of rounds! :o)\n\nResulting song title: Spike Tone Jones ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Funky Mr. Cold Banjo\n\n\n\n04 The 5 Jones Boys vs. Tone Loc vs. added percussion from Mixcraft loops\n\nLook down at Demo B below. Kinda reminds you of the first two tracks, huh? ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in the parentheses again! However, this song sounds a little more like the first one, only there have been tambourines, drumsticks, and maracas mixed into it. A combination mashup/remix, the extra percussion kinda covers up the weird beat of the original track! :o)\n\nResulting song title: The 5 Tone Loc Boys ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mr. Ghost Goes To Medina (Ty DeBoleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ReMashMix)\n\n\n\n05 Cypress Hill vs. Johnny Cash vs. Tone Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Insane In The Brain (percussion) vs. Ring Of Fire vs. Funky Cold Medina (percussion)\n\nNow THIS is what I call a masterpiece! This wonder track took eight long hours to remix together from the Sample Cash Mix trackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s idea! It contains only percussion portions of both of the other tracks with the FULL vocal of Ring Of Fire painstakingly mashed into this one. A very interesting version of the old country standby, plus itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s kinda funny with a few ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI dig itsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that hit just right by chance in a couple of spots, and the continuous horse sound from Cypress Hill throughout the song! :o)\n\nResulting song title: Cypress Cash Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Insane In The Ring Of Medina (Full Cash Mix)\n\n\n\n06 Da Yoopers vs. Tone Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Diarrhea vs. Funky Cold Medina (percussion)\n\nThis song stinks, if you know what I mean. Just look at the title! *LOL* If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re unfamiliar with Da Yoopers (on this track, anyway), they kinda sound like Richard CheeseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and if you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know who Richard Cheese is, then find him and listen to him! *LOL* Night club music meets rap beat on this one! :o) Notice also that the guitars from Funky Cold Medina were pitch-shifted to make the song more enjoyable to listen toÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦first try on this!\n\nResulting song title: Tone Yoopers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Funky Cold Diarrhea\n\n\n\n07 Orchestral Maneuvers In The Dark vs. The Jimmy Castor Bunch vs. Tone Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Enola Gay vs. The Bertha Butt Boogie (sample) vs. Funky Cold Medina (percussion)\n\nThis is one of the best tracks on this album. This was about a twelve-hour-to-make track that was well worth the time! :o) Kinda funny, though. The beat was almost the same as the OMD track! The rap beat fits well into this one. As far as the Jimmy Castor Bunch song, I had always wanted to do something with this one, but nothing worked with itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Check this out! This sample inspired me to make not one, but TWO tracks of the Jimmy Castor Bunch that worked out really well! :o)\n\nResulting song title: Orchestral Tone In The Castor Bunch ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Funky Cold Enola Butt Boogie\n\n\n\n08 The Jimmy Castor Bunch vs. Tone Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Troglodyte vs. Funky Cold Medina (percussion)\n\nHereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an old ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“70s track that I remember as a kid. It wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a major hit with many, but I like it. Hopefully you will like this version of it, too! ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very weird how well the rap beat went into this one. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s almost like Troglodyte was an early rap song or something, given there is all talking and no singing. Maybe this WAS a very early rap song and we just didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t KNOW it! *LOL*\n\nResulting song title: Tone Castor Bunch ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Troglodyte Medina\n\n\n\n09 The Jimmy Castor Bunch vs. Tone Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Bertha Butt Boogie vs. Funky Cold Medina (percussion &amp; sample)\n\nThis was the track I was inspired to make from the Funky Cold Enola Butt Boogie track. This was the first of the two tracks to be mixed but, due to which song originally came out first, this song had to be placed second of the two. Oh, wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦this track was good, but the Troglodyte track was better, at least in my opinionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ hehe I always said that you could mix anything to rapÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦looks like I\\'m right! *LOL*\n\nResulting song title: Tone Castor Bunch ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bertha Butt Medina\n\n\n\n10 Tone Loc vs. Tone Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Wild Thing vs. Funky Cold Medina\n\nWait a minuteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦HUH??? Must be a typo, you say? NOPE! I have done it again with this track! I just had to try mashing up two tracks by the same artist this timeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and even from the same ALBUM! This track features BOTH songs mashed together, first the vocal from one with the music of the other for a verse, then switch the other way! *LOL* Very different, very weird, and pretty funny, too! Enjoy! :o)\n\nResulting song title: Tone Tone Loc Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Funky Wild Cold Medina Thing\n\n\n\n11 (A) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Spike Jones vs. Tone Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mr. Banjo vs. Funky Cold Medina (percussion)\n\nJust the original version of these two mixed together, nothing specialÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Still sounds good, just not good enough for my standardsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ *LOL*\n\nResulting song title: Spike Tone Jones ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Funky Mr. Cold Banjo (Demo)\n\n\n12 (B) - The 5 Jones Boys vs. Tone Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mr. Ghost Goes To Town vs. Funky Cold Medina (broken percussion)\n\nOkay, define ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbroken percussionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ My definition of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbroken percussionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the part of the percussion that will fit into each beat of the resulting trackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦or something like that! The easy part about this track was the fact that it was a vocal only, with only The 5 Jones BoysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ voices used for everything in the original Mr. Ghost song. Then came the tough partÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦putting the beat into it! I had to carefully listen to the timing of the track, pick out every other beat, and place a beat at each spotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦just one beatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦then came the fun and funny partÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦the very strange beat that resulted from having to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œclipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the very first part of the beat from the whole beat for each measure! This is a very old song (Mr. Ghost, circa 1914) with a very new, interesting and funny twist! :o)\n\nResulting song title: The 5 Tone Loc Boys ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mr. Ghost Goes To Medina (Demo)\n\n\n\n13 (C) - Cypress Hill vs. Tone Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Insane In The Brain vs. Funky Cold Medina (percussion)\n\nI heard this track for the first time at work and KNEW I had a new hit song! This track contains the full Cypress Hill song and the percussion of Funky Cold Medina all mixed together for one weird sounding and funny basis for another TWO songsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦see if you can figure out which two?! *LOL*\n\nResulting song title: Cypress Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Insane In The Medina\n\n\n\n14 (D) - Cypress Hill vs. Johnny Cash vs. Tone Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Insane In The Brain vs. Ring Of Fire (samples) vs. Tone Loc (percussion)\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCashingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in on the country-rap idea, the Johnny Cash song just came to me out of nowhereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and went somewhere! *LOL* This is pretty much the same song as the last one, only different. It took three hoursÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ work just to add the tiny samples of Ring Of Fire to the already-existing Cypress Loc mix! This one is good, but the Full Cash Mix is BETTER! :o)\n\nResulting song title: Cypress Cash Loc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Insane In The Ring Of Medina (Sample Cash Mix)\n\n________________________________________\n\n\nWell, it\\'s been way too long since I\\'ve made one new album and, as we all know, the Funky Altered Medina album was a flop. I was going to remix the whole album so it sounded right, but switched PCs and lost all of my song templates... So much for a relatively easy job doing that now. It\\'s going to be a while, if ever now, that the Funky Altered Medina album will ever be something decent. I was also going to mix MJ with every track on that album and release it as a second part of that album...maybe much later...\n\nONWARD! This compilation is a sneak preview of the couple of albums I\\'m currently working on. Who knows when an album is going to be complete, but I can almost guess which one I\\'m going to finish first, by the number of completed tracks I have for it! *LOL* The first thing you will notice is that ALL of the beats match, up to the re-released tracks from the previous two albums. Those are my favorites! These new tracks are much better than I\\'ve ever done before. Also notice...NO DEMOS! I\\'ve decided that I don\\'t care HOW long it takes to finish an album, NO MORE DEMOS! If there are decent demo tracks to be heard, they will be released as a separate album.\n\nThis compilation is being released on 05-05-2009 (well, it was the 5th when I STARTED putting the compilation together), and contains 12 brand new songs or altered MJ versions of previous songs which did not have MJ in them before.\n\nI want to see if I should continue using MJ as my trademark, or if I should just move on.

You can also get songs as they happen if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a Yahoo Messenger friend of his. Just add ty_deboles_altered_tunes to your Yahoo Messenger! :o) The resulting album title for this set is:\n\n\n2009-05-13  The Sneak Preview Album (And A Few Faves)\n\n\nThe tracks list is as follows:\n\n\n\n01 Butthole Surfers vs Tone Loc vs Michael Jackson - Naked Man vs Funky Cold Medina (percussion) vs Black Or White (a cappella)\n\nThis was scheduled to be a track on the Funky Altered Medina: The Return Of MJ album, an exact duplicate of the Funky Altered Medina album, only with MJ in it to stop all the crying that I didn\\'t have him in the album. Looks like this track and the next one may be all there is for a long time now, because I got a better PC and lost ALL of my song templates! That means I would have to step back into yestermonth and completely remix them from scratch. I do NOT plan to fall that far back any time soon! :o( Oh, well, at least we have this song and the next one from the album that likely will never be now. Good thing you downloaded this album, huh? *LOL*\n\nResulting song title: Butt-Tone Jackson Surfers - Naked Cold Black Or White Medina (Medina Speed Mix)\n\n\n\n02 Cypress Hill vs Michael Jackson vs Johnny Cash vs Tone Loc - Insane In The Brain (percussion &amp; horsey sounds) vs Black Or White (a cappella) vs Ring Of Fire vs Funky Cold Medina (percussion)\n\nOkaaaayyyy....sure...uh huh...yeah RIGHT! That\\'s going to sound like a conglomeration of CRAP, man! Four songs crammed into one? Two rap beats, a country song AND MJ??? uh uh...don\\'t think so... I say \\&quot;Oh, but you\\'re WRONG, tyrannosaurus breath!\\&quot; *LOL* MJ actually sings in the trumpet parts, makes the old standby weird sounds and screams a few times, too! Every time fire or heat is referred to, MJ says OW, up to six times! *LOL* He even cuts Johnny off to announce This is the best part! hehe Speaking of hehe, there are plenty of the good old hehes in there, too! Sounds like a good old-fashioned Ty DeBole\\'s Altered Tunes tune! :o) Also from the would-have-been Funky Altered Medina: The Return Of MJ album.\n\nResulting song title: Cypress Michael Cash Loc - Insane In The Black Or White Ring Of Medina\n\n\n\n03 Bob Rivers vs John Fogerty - The Old Man Is On The Commode vs The Old Man Down The Road\n\nWha...HUH? Those two titles are almost identical! The songs almost are, too, until you listen to the lyrics. Bob Rivers is about the BEST parody artist I have ever heard. Bob\\'s session musicians sound almost identical to the original artists, in music AND song! See for yourself. If you have never heard Bob Rivers (or even if you have), you\\'re going to LOVE this album, because you get to hear both the original song AND the Bob Rivers version, all in one track! *LOL* In this one, the intros from BOTH songs are played together, to give you an idea how close the music is. Then the intro music from one plays while the singing of the other plays, and vice versa. The outros are played together as well, but the Bob Rivers one fades WAY before the John Fogerty one. Oh, well... It STILL sounds GREAT...and funny, too! :o) This album will be called Sounds Like Bob Rivers...and the original songs DO sound like Bob Rivers! *LOL*\n\nResulting song title: Bob Fogerty - The Old Man Down The Commode\n\n\n\n04 Bob Rivers vs Steppenwolf - Magic Comet Ride vs Magic Carpet Ride\n\nHmmmm... Is this track EVER going to start??? SHEESH! I\\'ve been listening for about five seconds, and I haven\\'t heard ANYTHING yet! Well, then listen for SIX seconds...it\\'s coming! *LOL* It\\'s just the way the two songs fade IN together. Yup, both intros playing side-by-side again, as with the instrumental part in the middle. The outro was impossible to do that way, though...both songs fade out with singing! ARGH! Oh, well, it was rough, but I semi-successfully worked first one and then the other in on the fade. That was the longest part of my job on that track! You\\'d better like this one, or else... I\\'m not saying \\&quot;or else what\\&quot;, though... Idle threats, anyway... That\\'s me... hehe\n\n\nResulting song title: Bob Steppenwolf - Magic Car-Met Ride\n\n\n\n05 Bob Rivers vs Hootie And The Blowfish - Three-Inch Tool vs Only Wanna Be With You\n\nIntros side-by-side again. Abrupt ending...makes for a FUNNY ending! Bob Rivers was slated to wind the song up, but wait until you hear the ending! *LOL* Once again, you will see the similarities between the original and parody here. Even if you don\\'t like the original song, please give this one a listen. You\\'ll LOVE the parody scattered throughout this one! *LOL*\n\nResulting song title: Bob And The Blowfish - Only Wanna Three-Inch Tool\n\n\n\n06 Bob Rivers vs Smashing Pumpkins - Minimum Wage vs Bullet With Butterfly Wings\n\nYou may look at both of these song titles and scratch your head and try to figure out exactly what the original song is and what the parody could possibly be...I did! *LOL* I had to go look up the lyrics on Wikipedia to even TRY to get the title for this song! Believe me, you will know this song, but you would NOT have expected the title to be Bullet With Butterfly Wings, unless you have the album, or REALLY know your music! *LOL* Both intros side-by-side, music overlapped and cut-and-pasted to make the track come together... The result of MANY hours\\' work turned out AWESOME! I have to say that I did a good job on this one! :o)\n\nResulting song title: Bob Pumpkins - Minimum Wage With Butterfly Wings\n\n\n\n07 Bob Rivers vs Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer - Ugly Man vs Lucky Man\n\nIntros run side-by-side, intro of one playing while the other sings and vice versa, middle instrumental side-by-side, both outros side-by-side until Bob\\'s version fades too quick again... *LOL* Some music overlapping and cut-and-pasting again. It\\'s fun to mash up Bob. The results are hilarious! *LOL* I hope you like this one! :o)\n\nResulting song title: Bob, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer - Lucky Ugly Man\n\n\n\n08 Bob Rivers vs Soundgarden - Asshole Son vs Black Hole Sun\n\nBetcha can just about figure THIS track\\'s name out, eh? *LOL* This track, not unlike the Bob Pumpkins track, was a BITCH! The result was well worth it, though! :o) Same process as the others; no need to keep repeating it for every track! *LOL* Quite a mix here, too! Enjoy! :o)\n\nResulting song title: Bobgarden - Black Asshole Sun Son\n\n\n\n09 Bob Rivers vs The Beatles - Baby Madonna vs Lady Madonna\n\nThis track was...easy, yet difficult in two places. The whole track was completed in a couple of hours, but there were a couple of little snags in the transition of the Bob Rivers track and The Beatles track that added an hour or so to the mix time... I\\'m pretty sure I have worked out all the bugs in this one now... Not a hilarious track, but it...sounds like Bob Rivers, just like the album title says! *LOL*\n\nResulting song title: Bob Beatles - Lady Baby Madonna\n\n\n\n10 Bob Rivers vs The Guess Who - Inflatable Woman vs American Woman\n\nOkay, NOW we\\'re talking some funny stuff here! The two intros are mixed...ho hum... Enough of how the tunes were made... The intros kinda sorta went together pretty well, but the acoustic guitars weren\\'t very loud, so they were hard to \\&quot;read\\&quot;... Still a pretty funny intro AND song. The endings couldn\\'t be put together, so I decided to cut the Guess Who ending and go with the Bob Rivers ending, which was far funnier! :o)\n\nResulting song title: Bob Guess Who - American Inflatable Woman\n\n\n\n\n11 New Order vs The Ramones - Confusion (Pump Panel Reconstruction Mix) vs Do You Remember Rock \\'N\\' Roll Radio\n\nThis track is AWESOME! The Ramones have been slowed down to match the techno beat here...I added about 20 seconds to the original running time of the song! *LOL* You might think that punk and techno don\\'t mix? WRONG! The resulting track sounds like a dance tune! *LOL* You have to hear it to believe it! This is the first track from the album being made for an Internet friend, the title of which has not yet been determined. It will contain Confusion in the title, but I have yet to nail down the first or second or whatever part of the album title, which will contain a nickname for my friend. The New Order - Confusion track will be featured as the main mash track for this one.\n\nResulting song title: New Ramones - Do You Remember Rock \\'N\\' Roll Confusion\n\n\n\n12 New Order vs The Ramones - Confusion (Pump Panel Reconstruction Mix) vs Beat On The Brat\n\nWhy two Ramones songs? Why not? *LOL* This is another track for my Internet friend\\'s album, the title of which still hasn\\'t been determined. This track is somewhat similar to the first, with one BIG difference. The techno track has been sped up to match the PUNK track! *LOL* The Ramones song is played at its original speed, which makes this track sound like a dance tune on speed! Just TRY to dance to this one! *LOL*\n\nResulting song title: New Ramones - Beat On The Confusion\n\n\n\n13 Robert Miles vs Queen - Children vs The Invisible Man\n\nNow if there ever was a weird track, this is it. The Queen song is the 12-inch single version, which is weird in itself! *LOL* This is the first and only track completed for the WarChildren album, which will feature the Robert Miles - Children track in each song of the album, in one form or another. It was sent to me from my friend to be mixed into an album. It\\'s a nice, mellow piano techno track. Let\\'s see what I can do to...uhhhh...WITH this track! *LOL* This album is being dedicated to one of two of my friends from Yahoo Messenger, whom I\\'ve known for over ten years! I felt it was time to make each of them an album.\n\nResulting song title: Queen Robert - The Invisible Children\n\n\n\n14 The Ventures vs Michael Jackson - Wipe Out vs Black Or White (a cappella)\n\nNo, this isn\\'t a rip\\'off from the first album; This is a different tune...much faster, and MJ gets all winded from singing so long and hard! Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂªLOLÃƒâ€šÃ‚Âª You must hear this one! Funny stuff! :o)\n\nResulting song title: Ventures Jackson - Black Or White Wipe Out\n\n\n\n15 Prince vs Michael Jackson - 1999 vs Black Or White (a cappella)\n\nOkay, somebody wondered what would happen if Prince and MJ did a song. Well, here is my idea of what would happen. MJ\\'s hehes have had their pitch changed and fit into the instrumental parts, along with other noises made in the Black Or White song, plus he sings a couple of bars, as well. Not a real funny track, but it goes together well! :o) Check it out!\n\nResulting song title: Prince Jackson - Black Or 1999\n\n\n\n\nLooks like you got your money\\'s worth on this release, even though you didn\\'t pay a penny for it! *LOL* It looks to me like my Sounds Like Bob Rivers Album will be the next one to hit the torrents, but who knows where my creativity will lead me? The next album COULD be the single song I have no idea what I\\'m going to do with! *LOL* All of you take care, and keep watching for the next Ty DeBole\\'s Altered Tunes album to emerge from the depths! :o) Remember, please contact me by the means stated above if you have anything on your mind, or even if you just want to be a friend of Ty DeBole\\'s Altered Tunes! Kinda like a fan club, you\\'ll get songs as they happen! All of you take care, and I hope to see you online real soon! :o)\n\n\n________________________________________\n\n\n\nHello again, everyone! I wish this album could have been released for a different reason, but I felt a need to pay tribute to my great inspiration for so many of my Altered Tunes: The King Of Pop, Michael Jackson.\n\nAs all of you know (who know my works), there are very few of my tunes that are not funny in one way or another. This album is very different. You might get one or two chuckles out of the Black Or White transitions in the first song, but that\\'s only because I had to change MJ\\'s singing tempo to match the beat of the beat underneath. This is my first attempt at making something NOT funny. None of this album was intended by me to be funny. If you find any part of this album the least bit amusing, I do apologize. It was not intentional.\n\nThis album had to be finished quickly in order to be released in a timely manner. Despite how quickly this album came to be, I spent many late nights working on it and put other things on hold to get it finished. The way I made the songs was to take the original and put the a capella versions alongside the full versions, adding a heavy reverb to only the a capella tracks. It was my intention to have MJ sound as if he were singing from Heaven. Each song was finished the same way, which is why this album didn\\'t take long to create. Not much creativity invloved here, although I did have to \\&quot;mash\\&quot; a few of the a capella tracks to get them to fit correctly into the main song. As of this release, I have not proofed many of these tracks in my car, as I normally do, so if there are any imperfections in any of the songs, I do apologize for that, too. As soon as I proof these songs, I will fix anything that isn\\'t right and re-release it later.\n\nMichael Jackson was a great artist. With his genius and my fair ability to make a mash-up, I was able to make some very interesting and funny mash-ups. It seemed that Black Or White just worked with anything I tried to make. The Tune that I consider to be the single from this album is no different. Each partial song in the Rest In Peace Mashup is tied together with it. The few who have heard songs from this album before I realeased it said that it was an awesome project, and that the Tunes I created here were equally awesome. I hope those of you who download it feel the same way. I also hope that my attempt to make a serious tribute to Michael Jackson will be just that, too.\n\nGoodbye, Michael, and as I have titled my album, Rest In Peace.\n\n\n\n2009-07-14  Ty DeBole\\'s Altered Tunes Presents: Michael Jackson - Rest In Peace\n\n\nThere is only one track on this album that needs any explanation at all. The rest of it was explained above, so there is no need to cover that here. The Rest In Peace Mashup includes seven original songs, plus the a capella version of Black Or White. I made Black Or White a bit more special in this Tune because it\\'s kind of like my trademark. It seems to fit into anything (except for Rock And White, Part 2 on my first album). So I decided to tie all of the partial songs AND even the final song of my single together with it. The first two songs are kinda by themselves, so to speak, because there was no real isolated beat in either of them. I just felt a need to include a couple of his early songs in the mix. So at the beginning, you hear the tie, The Jackson 5\\'s ABC, the tie, and Michael Jackson\\'s Ben. Things change drastically at the next tie. The beat from Billie Jean is under it AND Thriller and the next tie. Each song you hear in this track has the next song\\'s beat under it. When MJ actually sings Billie Jean, you hear the beat from Beat It. While listening to Beat It, you will hear the beat from Bad. When you listen to Bad, you will hear a VERY familiar beat WITH guitar underneath...from Black Or White. The tie here fits better than any other song because it IS the song...Black Or White. This is where I first decided to make this an album, rather than just a single. My friends at work loved my single and I loved the way Black Or White turned out in this single, so I decided to make the rest of the album the same way. I hope you enjoy it as much as my firends and I have so far. Thanks in advance for listening! :o)\n\nI now present to you... Michael Jackson\\'s Rest In Peace...\n\n01 Rest In Peace Mashup\n02 ABC\n03 Ben\n04 Billie Jean\n05 Bad\n06 Black Or White\n07 Dancing Machine\n08 They Don\\'t Care About Us, version 1\n09 Scream\n10 They Don\\'t Care About Us, version 2\n\n\n\nThe reason there are two versions of They Don\\'t Care About Us was I had two different a capellas of it. They were so different that I decided to make both versions presented here. Songs that are not here that were in the single I just didn\\'t have the a capellas for, and I am not educated in the art of creating them. I tried to just cut and paste the MJ vocal parts from the original songs and paste them where the a capella would go, but it sounded like crap, as you will most likely find out in Dancing Machine, where I only had a partial a capella. It sounds like crap with the percussion reverbing with his voice, but the Tune had to be finished. It\\'s slightly better than nothing, I guess. I\\'ll proof it and decide whether to keep it or dump it. Also, leave comments on this album to help me decide what to do! If any of you have a capellas of the Tunes I didn\\'t include in the album, please step forward! I will personally thank you and credit you in this space! :o)\n\nThank you in advance again for listening. I want to also thank Michael Jackson for lending me his voice for this and the rest of my albums, and I would like to thank God for giving me the talent to put these albums together.\n\nLord, take care of Michael Jackson for us all who loved his work and what he stood for. ...and please make sure that he will...Rest In Peace... Amen\n\n\n________________________________________\n\n\nWell, it\\'s been about a year since I have made an album. Things in my life have made a drastic change for the better, but the drastic change part is the part that took me away from my \\&quot;music.\\&quot;  I won\\'t say how, but I lost all of my 1,000+ CDs, all of my records and all of my computer stuff, with the exception of my PC and 1.5 TB external hard drive.  Sound drastic enough?  *LOL*  Anyway, this album and the next one render the Sneak Preview Album worthless, because it\\'s now a compilation album made before these two albums were released!  Something is seriously wrong with this picture!  *LOL*  I only left the Sneak Preview Album in this collection for historical purposes, since I had made the album beforehand.  This album features Bob Rivers vs the original artists with intros, outros and other parts of both tracks running side-by-side wherever possible.  Most of these tracks are very funny because I place the Bob Rivers material strategically into the original song to not only lengthen the final tune, but to make you LISTEN to the tune, as well.  Most of Bob Rivers\\' parodies sound so much like the original song that you usually HAVE to listen to every word of every Altered Tune to hear the difference in lyrics.  After listening to this album, you will see that most of the original artists CAN sound like Bob Rivers!  *LOL*  Therefore, this album is titled:\n\n\n\n2010-07-14  Sounds Like Bob Rivers\n\n\n01 Bob Rivers vs John Fogerty - The old Man (Is On The Commode) vs The Old Man Down The Road\n\n   Resulting song title:  Bob Fogerty - The Old Man Down The Commode\n\n\n02 Bob Rivers vs Steppenwolf - Magic Comet Ride vs Magic Carpet Ride\n\n   Resulting song title:  Bob Steppenwolf - Magic Car-Met Ride\n\n\n03 Bob Rivers vs Hootie And The Blowfish - Three-Inch Tool vs Only Wanna Be With You\n\n   Resulting song title:  Bob And The Blowfish - Only Wanna Three-Inch Tool\n\n\n04 Bob Rivers vs Smashing Pumpkins - Minimum Wage vs Bullet With Butterfly Wings\n\n   Resulting song title:  Bob Pumpkins - Minimum Wage With Butterfly Wings\n\n\n05 Bob Rivers vs Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer - What An Ugly Man He Was vs Lucky Man\n\n   Resulting song title:  Bob, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer - Lucky Ugly Man\n\n\n06 Bob Rivers vs Soundgarden - Asshole Son vs Black Hole Sun\n\n   Reulting song title:  Bobgarden - Black Ass Hole Sun Son\n\n\n07 Bob Rivers vs The Beatles - Baby Madonna vs Lady Madonna\n\n   Resulting song title:  Bob Beatles - Lady Baby MAdonna\n\n\n08 Bob Rivers vs The Guess Who - Inflatable Woman vs American Woman\n\n   Resulting song title:  Bob Guess Who - American Inflatable Woman\n\n\n09 Bob Rivers vs Sly And The Family Stone - Rap\\'s Not Even Music vs Dance To The Music\n\n   Resulting song title:  Bob And The Family Stone - Rap\\'s Not Even Dance Music\n\n\n10 Bob Rivers Vs Creedence Clearwater Revival - Burned On The Bar-B-Q vs Born On The Bayou\n\n   Resulting song title:  Creedence Bobwater Revival - Born On The Bar-B-Q\n\n\n11 Bob Rivers vs KISS - I Have To Get To Bed By 9 vs Rock And Roll All Nite\n\n   Resulting song title:  Bob KISS - Rock And Roll By 9\n\n\n12 Bob Rivers vs The Doors - Burgers On The Grill vs Riders On The Storm\n\n   Resulting song title:  The Bob Doors - Riders On The Grill\n\n\n________________________________________\n\n\n\nThis, my sixth album, is a bit different from the others.  Since it looks like the Funky Altered Medina:  The return Of MJ album won\\'t be for quite a while, if ever, I just took the two finished tracks for that album and put them here, just to give them a home.  The same for the two New Ramones tracks and the Queen Robert track, which were slated to be parts of two separate albums for a couple of Internet friends.  Seven tracks of this album are from the Sneak Preview Album, which renders the Sneak album worthless now, since I have now exhausted all of the tracks from that album to create and finish this album and the Sounds Like Bob Rivers album.  Also notice that there are no demos at all in this album, and that there are 16 tracks here as opposed to the other albums\\' 15 or fewer tracks.  The title of this album comes from what a friend of mine calls my music:  mix and mash.  hehe  Since there is such a strange conglomeration of tracks in this album, I chose to call it:\n\n\n\n2010-07-19  Mix And Mash-Up\n\n\n01 Michael Jackson vs Michael Jackson vs Unknown - Black Or White vs Black Or White (acappella) vs Mushrooms\n\n   Okay, here\\'s a strange twist on a mash-up...Making a duet with the same person singing both parts with pitch-changed game music mixed in as the intro and background!  *LOL*  Yup, MJ\\'s song track got pitch-changed and the acapella stayed the same.  I think the game music from Mushroom Age adds kind of a sci-fi sound to the track.  I hope you enjoy this one!  :o)\n\n   Resulting song title:  Michael Mushroom Jackson - Black Or Mushrooms (Duet Mix 1)\n\n\n02 Butthole Surfers vs Tone Loc vs Michael Jackson - Naked Man vs Funky Cold Medina (percussion) vs Black Or White (acappella sounds)\n\n   This was originally supposed to be the first track of the Funky Altered Medina:  The Return Of MJ album, but since it\\'s put off indefinitely, I gave it a home here for now.  It\\'s the same track as Naked Cold Medina on the Funky Altered Medina album, only with MJ added.\n\n   Resulting song title: Butt-Tone Jackson Surfers - Naked Cold Black Or White Medina (Medina Speed Mix)\n\n\n03 Cypress Hill vs Tone Loc vs Michael Jackson vs Johnny Cash - Insane In The Brain (percussion) vs Funky Cold Medina (percussion) vs Black Or White (Acappella singing and sounds) vs Ring Of Fire\n\n   This was to be another track for the Funky Altered Medina: The Return Of MJ album, but it shares the same fate as the previous track. It\\'s the same track as Insane In The Ring Of Medina on the Funky Altered Medina album, only with MJ added.\n\n   Reulting song title:  Cypress Michael Cash Loc - Insane In The Black Or White Ring Of Medina\n\n\n04 New Order vs The Ramones - Confusion (Pump Panel Reconstruction Mix) vs Do You Remember Rock &amp; Roll Radio\n\n   Techno meets punk in this dance-mix-sounding track. To make the two tracks match, I had to slow the Ramones down to the point there were about twenty seconds added to the length of the original song. This is a very different sound for the Ramones!\n\n   Resulting song title:  New Ramones - Do You Remember Rock &amp; Roll Confusion (Dance Mix)\n\n\n05 Robert Miles vs Queen - Children vs The Invisible Man\n\n   Dance music with...QUEEN???  Yup, beautiful piano music and altered synthesizers combine with this rather strange Queen track to make a brand new hit song from two otherwise little-known songs!  Enjoy!  :o)\n\n   Resulting song title:  Queen Robert - The Invisible Children\n\n\n06 The Ventures vs Michael Jackson - Wipe Out vs Black Or White (acappella samples)\n\n   Okay, MJ, let\\'s get busy to the point you get completely winded!  *LOL*  This is quite a hilarious track where MJ dares to just say \\&quot;It\\'s Black, It\\'s White, It\\'s Black, It\\'s White\\&quot; as fast as the Ventures play Wipe Out.  During the drum breaks, you can hear MJ attempting to catch his breath.  The breathing gets faster as the tune progresses!  *LOL*  Poor MJ...  Maybe that\\'s what caused him his early demise...?  HEHE  HEHE\n\n   Resulting song title:  Ventures Jackson - Black Or White Wipe Out\n\n\n07 New Order vs The Ramones - Confusion (Pump Panel Reconstruction Mix) vs Beat On The Brat\n\n   Techno meets punk again and the roles have been reversed.  This time the techno has been sped up to meet the punk.  A very short dance track that I just DARE you to try to dance to!  *LOL*\n\n   Resulting song title:  New Ramones - Beat On The Confusion\n\n\n08 Prince vs Michael Jackson - 1999 vs Black Or White (acappella singing and altered sounds)\n\n   Somebody was wondering what Prince and MJ would sound like together.  Well, here\\'s my first impression of what it would sound like.  HEHE HEHE\n\n   Resulting song title:  Prince Jackson - Black Or 1999\n\n\n09 Diana Ross vs Diana Ross vs Diana Ross - Upside Down vs Upside Down (acappella verse 1) vs Upside Down (acappella verse 2)\n\n   Now we\\'re really getting weird.  This is a Diana Ross trio, of all things!  She actually sings sings two verses at the same time, the two like verses pitch-changed on the acappella version to get a duet sound...then the second verse is added unchanged while the first verse is playing, giving it a...what would you call it...Row, Row, Row Your Boat sound!  *LOL*  Enjoy!\n\n   Resulting song title:  Diana Ross X3 - Upside Down (Trio Mix)\n\n\n10 Orchestral Maneuvres In The Dark vs Tone Loc vs The Jimmy Castor Bunch - Enola Gay vs Funky Cold Medina vs Bertha Butt Boogie (intro)\n\n   Nothing too astonishing here; just a different sound from the original which appeared on the Funky Altered Medina album.  Seems to have fixed the slightly staggered beat of the original.\n\n   Resulting song title:  Orchestral Tone In The Castor Bunch - Funky Cold Enola Butt Boogie Remixed\n\n\n11 Blue Man Group vs Vincent Price - Sing Along vs Thriller Rap (acappella)\n\n   The original Sing Along with isolated instrumental loops inserted where you can hear Vincent Price\\'s full-version Thriller Rap with unreleased verses!  :o)  Pretty good stuff here!\n\n   Resulting song title:  Blue Man Price - Sing Along Rap (Full Price Mix)\n\n\n12 New Order vs Michael Jackson vs Zylom game music - Confusion (Pump Panel Reconstruction Mix) vs Black Or White (acappella) vs Gold Rush\n\n   Same techno track used for an Internet friend\\'s album mixed with game music from Gold Rush and MJ \\&quot;singing\\&quot; Black Or White at the end.\n\n   Resulting song title:  New Michael Zylom - Black Or Gold Confusion Rush\n\n\n13 DJ Valium feat.
