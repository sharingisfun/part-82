To counter this tactic, the Confederates outfitted stealthy, fast and powerful ships known as blockade runners. The Mary Celestia was one such ship, and like many of her kind, she did not survive to see the end of the war. But her end has puzzled Civil War scholars for generations, for the Mary Celestia was broken on the reefs off Bermuda in September of 1864.\n\nWhat was the vessel doing so far from the battle? What happened to her cargo? With one of Bermuda's most experienced mariners at the helm, how did she end up on the reefs? Working with nautical archaeologists and experts from the Bermuda Maritime Museum, the DEEP SEA DETECTIVES attempt to answer the questions that have confounded Civil War scholars for so long.\n\nFile Size ------- 348mb\nLength ---------- 44:34\nResolution ------ 720x480\nContainer ------- mkv\nVideo Codec ----- x264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 30\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k\nThanks to (anonymous) for the generous seedbox donation.\nAlso Supported by \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://magnet-dev.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://magnet-dev.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17401bee663f1107080051fb2ed0d65cd861c143","amp;dn":"History+Channe%3A+The+Confederacy%5C%27s+Secret+Weapon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17401bee663f1107080051fb2ed0d65cd861c143","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,64,27,238,102,63,17,7,8,0,81,251,46,208,214,92,216,97,193,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
