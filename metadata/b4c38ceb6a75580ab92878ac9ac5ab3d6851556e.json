Committed for being a habitual runaway, Blair is, for all her surface toughness, unworldly and naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve. All this changes in the reformatory, with Blair rapidly becoming as hard, callous, and irredeemable as her fellow detentionees. Even upon her probationary release, she shows no sign of being &quot;cured&quot; by her incarceration. The film's most notorious scene -- Blair's rape by broom-handle -- was all the more horrifying because there was no pre-show warning issued by the network. So disturbing was the sequence that it was removed from all subsequent network telecasts of Born Innocent. \n--Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_Innocent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_Innocent&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4c38ceb6a75580ab92878ac9ac5ab3d6851556e","amp;dn":"Born+Innocent+--+1974+--+Starring+Linda+Blair","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4c38ceb6a75580ab92878ac9ac5ab3d6851556e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,195,140,235,106,117,88,10,185,40,120,172,154,197,171,61,104,81,85,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
