Kelton hosts the Rule Of Law Radio program and is the founder of jurisimprudence.com. Kelton has discussed with Alex how the legal system can be used against corrupt cops, district, city, county attorneys, and judges. Quoting from his Juris-Imprudence, Kelton notes: &quot;No official has any immunity from criminal prosecution. The power to take back control of the legal system lies in that simple realization. The real check to abuse of power has always been in the hands of the people, yours and mine.&quot; \n[hour 3]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ruleoflawradio.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ruleoflawradio.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mortgagecrime.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mortgagecrime.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAlex extends the show into a 4th hour, continuing his conversation with Randy Kelton.\nThe fourth hour ends with Alex playing the trailer for the documentary, Enemy of the State.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
