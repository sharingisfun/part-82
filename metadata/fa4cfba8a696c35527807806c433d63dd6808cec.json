What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa4cfba8a696c35527807806c433d63dd6808cec","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+July+29+TH+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa4cfba8a696c35527807806c433d63dd6808cec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,76,251,168,166,150,195,85,39,128,120,6,196,51,214,61,214,128,140,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
