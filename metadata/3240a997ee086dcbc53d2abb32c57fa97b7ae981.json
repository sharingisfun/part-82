Don't read this, or else the NSA will have to kill you, at least they would have before 1989. Why do you think basements of government buildings in the US are made of concrete?

Maybe, probably not.\n\ntags: American, US, cryptology, cryptography, encryption, secret, NSA, 1945, 1989, Cold War, Soviet, USSR, Russia, declassified, top secret, history, UMBRA, CIA, intelligence","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3240a997ee086dcbc53d2abb32c57fa97b7ae981","amp;dn":"American+Cryptology+1945-1989+%5BUMBRA.Declassified%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3240a997ee086dcbc53d2abb32c57fa97b7ae981","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,64,169,151,238,8,109,203,197,61,42,187,50,197,127,169,123,122,233,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
