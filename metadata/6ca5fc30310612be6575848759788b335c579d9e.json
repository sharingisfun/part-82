Using groundbreaking filming techniques and state-of-the-art scientific technologies, the book and the documentary on which it is based are epic in every sense, charting six seasonal events that transform entire ecosystems and the life experiences of the thousands of animals within them, from the largest mammals to the smallest microorganisms.\n\nThe six events include the flooding of the Okavango Delta in Botswana, which turns sprawling swaths of desert into an elaborate maze of lagoons and swamps; the melting of 10 million square kilometers of ice in the Arctic, which imperils polar bears across the region; the migration of the Serengeti, where life is on the edge for both predator and prey and where lions and wildebeest battle to survive; the great salmon run in British Columbia, where rivers teem with thousands of fishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and where grizzlies and wolves eagerly await them; the explosion of sea life in AlaskaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s coastal waters, where countless animals from far and wide brave killer whales to feed; and the greatest marine spectacle on the planet, the annual tide of sardines along South AfricaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s east coast, where the greatest concentration of predatorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including sharks and dolphinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½come to feast.\n\nThese events are among the processes most important to the survival of life on the planet. Tracking them at every stage with over 400 remarkable photographs throughout, the book follows individual animals as they live and die during these events, often capturing the drama from their unique point of view. The result is an awe-inspiring and truly novel work that brings these events into more brilliant focus than ever before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: David Attenborough   \n===============================\n\n\nProduced by: Hugh Pearson\n=========================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................: Nature's Great Events [Episode IV Of VI] The Great Tide\nYear.................: 2009\nGenre................: Documentary \nVideo Length.........: 00:59:05\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........: 256 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........: (AC3)\nLanguage.............: English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.: 16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........: XviD \nVideo Resolution.....: 720x400\nVIdeo Bitrate........: 1757 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................: External English\nFile Size:...........: 742 MB\nFPS..................: 29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........: 2 channels\nRelease date.........: 29 May 2009\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisodes:\n=========\n\n1)The Great Melt\n2)The Great Salmon Run\n3)The Great Migration\n4)The Great Tide\n5)The Great Flood\n6)The Great Feast\n\n\n\n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1380596/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1380596/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ca5fc30310612be6575848759788b335c579d9e","amp;dn":"Nature%5C%27s+Great+Events%5BEpisode+IV+Of+VI%5D-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ca5fc30310612be6575848759788b335c579d9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,165,252,48,49,6,18,190,101,117,132,135,89,120,139,51,92,87,157,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
