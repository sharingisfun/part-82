The book was designed by Chip Kidd with the assistance of photographer Geoff Spear. It collects a Japanese shÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½nen manga adaptation of the American comic book series Batman by Jiro Kuwata simply entitled Batman and also includes photographs of vintage Batman toys from Japan.  \n\nIn 1966, Batman manga was created during the Batman craze in Japan, when the hit US TV series came to Japanese television audiences. The shÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½nen magazine ShÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½nen King and its publisher ShÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½nen GahÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½sha licensed the rights to make their own Batman stories, with Batman\\'s original publisher, DC Comics full consent. A year later, the stories stopped. They were never collected in Japan, and never translated into English. Bat-Manga!: The Secret History of Batman in Japan, collects and translates the series for the first time, appearing alongside stunning photographs of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most comprehensive collection of vintage Japanese Batman toys, along with an exclusive interview with Jiro Kuwata, the manga master who originally wrote and drew the Batman manga series. \n\nThis is The Dynamic Duo as youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never seen them, with a distinctly Japanese, atomic-age twist as they battle aliens, mutated dinosaurs, and villains who wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stay dead. \n\n\nReleased on &lt;a href=&quot; http://ComicPirates.info&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://ComicPirates.info&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16cde2f446dd981a56ce43eca6e25d0e3911de2e","amp;dn":"Bat-Manga%21+-+The+Secret+History+of+Batman+in+Japan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16cde2f446dd981a56ce43eca6e25d0e3911de2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,205,226,244,70,221,152,26,86,206,67,236,166,226,93,14,57,17,222,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
