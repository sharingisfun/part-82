Several controversial death penalty cases are currently under examination in Texas and in other states, but it's the 2004 execution of Cameron Todd Willingham --convicted for the arson deaths of his three young children -- that's now at the center of the national debate. With unique access to those closest to the case, FRONTLINE examines the Willingham conviction in light of new science that raises doubts about whether the fire at the center of the case was really arson at all. The film meticulously examines the evidence used to convict Willingham, provides an in-depth portrait of those most impacted by the case and explores the explosive implications of a possibly innocent man.\nDuration: 00:56:46 TVPG CC STEREO DVS\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 549 MiB for 55mn 39s 673ms\nSource            : PBS HD\nCodec             : XviD\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 232 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 352 (1.773) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 134 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd9a598512fba6db1ee10f3d35d0f763723fddb9","amp;dn":"PBS.Frontline.S29E01.19.Oct.2010.HDTV.XviD-Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd9a598512fba6db1ee10f3d35d0f763723fddb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,154,89,133,18,251,166,219,30,225,15,61,53,208,247,99,114,63,221,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
