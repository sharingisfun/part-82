The album reached 111 on the Billboard charts, and produced the single &quot;Keep Playin' That Rock and Roll&quot; that went to No.70 on Billboard's Top 100.\n\nReview\tby Michael B. Smith\n\nPerhaps one of his best-loved albums, Edgar Winter's White Trash combined funk, blues, R&amp;B, and rock &amp; roll to create one of the freshest sounds of the early '70s. Touching on gospel with &quot;Fly Away&quot; and &quot;Save the Planet,&quot; Winter and his band cover all the bases, climbing into the lower end of the Top 40 with &quot;Keep Playin' That Rock and Roll.&quot; Winter's hauntingly beautiful &quot;Dying to Live,&quot; featuring some of his best piano work, serves as a valid anti-war statement, written at the height of the Vietnam era, and the remainder of the record is filled with genuine rock &amp; roll/boogie-woogie/blues that will keep your head bobbing and your toes tapping. \n\n   \n1.  &quot;Give It Everything You Got&quot; (Jerry Lacroix, Edgar Winter) - 4:33\n2.  &quot;Fly Away&quot; (Lacroix, Winter) - 3:02\n3.  &quot;Where Would I Be&quot; (Lacroix, Winter) - 3:59\n4.  &quot;Let's Get It On&quot; (Lacroix, Winter) - 5:05\n5.  &quot;I've Got News for You&quot; (Ray Alfred) - 3:56\n6.  &quot;Save the Planet&quot; (Lacroix, Winter) - 5:41\n7.  &quot;Dying to Live&quot; (Winter) - 4:04\n8.  &quot;Keep Playin' That Rock &amp; Roll&quot; (Winter) - 3:46\n9.  &quot;You Were My Light&quot; (Winter) - 5:02\n10. &quot;Good Morning Music&quot; (Lacroix, Winter) - 4:20\n\n\nEnjoy &amp; please don't forget to SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a44107c8bd8dce65225ae327b7504bde50c2a3a3","amp;dn":"Edgar+Winter%5C%27s+White+Trash-White+Trash+%281971%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a44107c8bd8dce65225ae327b7504bde50c2a3a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,65,7,200,189,141,206,101,34,90,227,39,183,80,75,222,80,194,163,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
