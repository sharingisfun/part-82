A head-spinning flurry of notes that only lets up long enough to squeeze some more emotion from another bend or two, it's the scrappiest, flashiest statement of purpose a person could hope for in an artist half his age\n\n\n\n\nTracklist\n01. 74 years young 04:34\n02. Thank me someday 05:42\n03. On the road 04:11\n04. Stay around a little longer (witht. B.B. King) 05:00\n05. Key don't fit 05:02\n06. Living proof 03:45\n07.
