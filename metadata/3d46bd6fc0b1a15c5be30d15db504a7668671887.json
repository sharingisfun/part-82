That night, listeners heard Willie Bobo on timbales and drum set and Mongo Santamaria on bongos and other percussion. They found Paul Horn on flute and also saxophone, Lonnie Hewitt on piano, and Al McKibbon on bass, while Tjader mellowed the timbre with his vibes. Only a few tunes had an up-tempo, vigorous Afro-Cuban feel; straight ahead ballads, such as Laura and We'll Be Together Again, and mainstream grooves, original or neo-standards, such as Walkin' with Wally and 'Round Midnight, were well represented. After all, this was a mixed, mainly mainstream audience, and there was something for everyone. This 78-minute live album, consisting of tracks from the two original LPs, sound great. That is good engineering, both at the time and with mastering afterwards. The album, in short, is historic and brilliant and thoroughly enjoyable. I particularly liked the Latin pieces, Tu Crees Que, for instance. ~ Dr. Debra Jan Bibel\n\nPersonnel:\nCal Tjader (vibes);\nAl McKibbon (bass);\nPaul Horn (flute);\nLonnie Hewitt (piano, drums);\nWillie Bobo (drums, timbales);\nMongo SantamarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a (congas, bongos, percussion)\n\nCal Tjader - Monterey Concerts Tracks:\n01  Doxy\n02  Afro Blue\n03  Laura\n04  Walkin' With Wally\n05  We'll be Together Again\n06  'Round Midnight\n07  Love me or Leave me\n08  TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº Crees Que\n09  S.
