In this case it's John Saxon \n(as &quot;The Modoc Kid&quot;) and his younger partner \nplayed by Harrison Ford.\n\nDon't think Ford was any good here, because he \nwasn't. I never cared for him as an actor, in spite \nof him being in 3 of the most popular movie series of \nall time:  Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and two of the \nJack Ryan spy films. This was one of his first roles\nthough, hence the &quot;Introducing Harrison Ford&quot; credit.\n\nBut thanks to the acting of John Saxon, Charles Bickford,\nand Don Quine, plus a good script this has become one\nof my favorite episodes. After all, how can you go\nwrong if the story has a family being held at gunpoint\nin their own home and what they do to outsmart the outlaws?\n\nThis episode should be more noteable in that we get to \nsee both Ryker and Abbott working together again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc0ab52da1edda4bb9182fd41e24e46216ba6150","amp;dn":"THE+VIRGINIAN+--+The+Modoc+Kid+%28+John+Saxon%2C+Harrison+Ford+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc0ab52da1edda4bb9182fd41e24e46216ba6150","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,10,181,45,161,237,218,75,185,24,47,212,30,36,228,98,22,186,97,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
