Shane Mosley makes his &quot;Last Stand&quot;  \n   when he faces former world champion Sergio Mora in Los Angeles.         \n                                                                           \n   Mosley has been one of the best &quot;Pound for Pound&quot; fighters of the past  \n   decade.                                                                 \n                                                                           \n   In 2000, he inflicted Oscar De La Hoya's first loss, and along the way  \n   he has collected world championships in three different divisions,       \n   defeating some of the world best fighters.                              \n                                                                           \n   But at 39 time is not on his side but the skill set he brings to the    \n   ring remain a massive threat to his opponents.                          \n                                                                           \n   Despite entering his clash with Floyd Mayweather as a huge underdog     \n   last May, he rocked the favourite to his very core early in the bout,   \n   and came within a couple of punches of causing a monumental upset.      \n                                                                           \n   For this reason, Sergio Mora will need to be wary of his aging opponent.\n                                                                           \n   Nicknamed &quot;The Latin Snake&quot;, Mora made himself a household name due to  \n   his success on the hugely popular &quot;Contender&quot; series. That led to a     \n   world title winning effort against Vernon Forrest, where he lifted the   \n   WBC Light Middleweight Title.                                           \n                                                                           \n   He lost the title in his first defense but with a resolve backed up by  \n   his ability, Mora is now determined to fulfill his potential and punch  \n   his way back into world title contention.                               \n                                                                           \n   To do so, he must defeat Shane Mosley.                                  \n                                                                           \n   Can Mosley go out in a blaze of glory?
