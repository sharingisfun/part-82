Cutting for Stone won the award for \nAdult Fiction.The award will be presented at BookExpo America 2010 in \nNew York later this month. Cutting for Stone also won the award for\nFiction for books published in 2009 from the Northern California Independent\nBookseller Association.\n\nThe story is a riveting saga of twin brothers, Marion and Shiva Stone, \nborn of a tragic union between a beautiful Indian nun and a brash British \nsurgeon at a mission hospital in Addis Ababa. Orphaned by their mother's \ndeath in childbirth and their father's disappearance, and bound together \nby a preternatural connection and a shared fascination  with medicine, \nthe twins come of age as Ethiopia hovers on the brink of revolution.\n\nBut it's love, not politics -- their passion for the same woman -- that \nwill tear them apart and force Marion to flee his homeland and make his \nway to America, finding refuge in his work at an underfunded, overcrowded \nNew York City hospital. When the past catches up to him, wreaking havoc \nand destruction, Marion has to entrust his life to the two men he has \ntrusted least in the world: the surgeon father who abandoned him and the\nbrother who betrayed him.\n- - -\n\nFrom Wiki:\nAbraham Verghese (1955) is the Professor for the Theory and Practice of \nMedicine at Stanford University Medical School and Senior Associate Chair \nof the Department of Internal Medicine.[1] He was born in Ethiopia to \nparents from Kerala in south India who, along with hundreds of Keralites, \nworked as teachers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb66d678b930fed9581473f55107cf837e99b128","amp;dn":"CUTTING+FOR+STONE+-+Abraham+Verghese.+Sunil+Malhotra+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb66d678b930fed9581473f55107cf837e99b128","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,102,214,120,185,48,254,217,88,20,115,245,81,7,207,131,126,153,177,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
