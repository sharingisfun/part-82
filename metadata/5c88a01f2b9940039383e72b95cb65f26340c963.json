Make sure that you select Windows Media Player for the .mp4 options. If you installed it properly when you play them with WMP an icon will appear in the notificaton area on the task bar.\n\nFor Linux and Mac users you might have to research better codecs\n\nFor PS3 or XBOX 360 owners put the race on a flashdrive or external hard drive and play it with them\n\nI looked around for other torrents with 720p. I tried to match the video bitrate that they were using and I found that I did not lose any quality. The bitrate is between what I was using for the 960x540 uploads and 1280x720. \n\nI am using my laptop as an average setup. I bought it 2 years ago for $500. It has an Intel Duo Core processor 1.60 GHz with 3 GB of RAM. These videos play fine on that laptop.\n\nI cannot please everyone but beleive me I am trying my best. I am trying to provide the best quality HD videos I can and trying to make it possible for just about everyone to be able to play them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c88a01f2b9940039383e72b95cb65f26340c963","amp;dn":"2010+AMA+450+Motocross+Rd+8+Washougal+HD+720p+Slicknick610.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c88a01f2b9940039383e72b95cb65f26340c963","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,136,160,31,43,153,64,3,147,131,231,43,149,203,101,242,99,64,201,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
