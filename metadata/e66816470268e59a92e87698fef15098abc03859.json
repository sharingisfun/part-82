It was an achievement worthy of an international press conference with President Bill Clinton in the White House.\n\nThe Human Genome Project involved thousands of scientists in many different countries, cost hundreds of millions of pounds and took more than ten years. It was the first big science project for biology.\n\nBut what have been the benefits and advances a decade on?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e66816470268e59a92e87698fef15098abc03859","amp;dn":"Dawkins+-+The+Age+Of+The+Genome","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e66816470268e59a92e87698fef15098abc03859","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,104,22,71,2,104,229,154,146,232,118,152,254,241,80,152,171,192,56,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
