This is the offer given to Norma and Arthur, an ordinary decent couple played by Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, by the mysterious Arlington Steward (Frank Langella).  The question &quot;What would you do?&quot; will ring in your ears as you witness that their decision is just the beginning.  Based on a short story by the writer of I AM LEGEND and from the director of DONNIE DARKO, The Box takes you on a tense, gripping and totally unpredictable ride as the couple realise that they are part of something greater and far more terrifying than they could ever have imagined.\n\nHope you enjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ea10b72f2b6c6403db0aade65c05bd175bdab0f","amp;dn":"The+Box%5B2009%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5D-KRMovies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ea10b72f2b6c6403db0aade65c05bd175bdab0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,161,11,114,242,182,198,64,61,176,170,222,101,192,91,209,117,189,171,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
