After today, a lot of the pre-existing conditions in the healthcare system itself will cease to exist. Starting now, insurance companies will no longer be allowed to exclude children because of pre-existing health conditions. Using the term ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpre-existing conditionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ about a young child is tantamount to saying they were just born wrong. After today insurers can no longer impose lifetime limits on coverage. That should extend a few lifetimesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ but then I guess thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s basically what health insurers were afraid of in the first place. Also, now kids can stay on their parentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ policies up to age 26, which makes a lot of sense. With the way the economy is, most people under 30 are still living with their parents anyway. And now insurers canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t drop you after you get sick if they can find a technical mistake on your application. So if you have a problem with your colon, you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be dropped because of a misplaced semi-colon on your application. Speaking of which, now preventive procedures, like colonoscopies, mammograms and immunizations must be covered without co-paymentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½because the only thing worse than having your breasts mashed into tortillas is being charged to have it done. Free colonoscopies are good news, too. Now you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be charged for having a camera put up your butt, provided of course, that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s being done by a doctor.\n\nWhich reminds me of what Republicans want to do to you. Today the Republicans unveiled their ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPledge to America.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 21 pages long. Does it really take that long to say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdestroy the middle classÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½? This plan doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t move America forward, it divvies America up between the rich. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Pledge to America!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ At least theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re smart enough not to use the term ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcontractÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ any more. Too many mob jokes last time. But is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpledgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the best term to use when your plan is being introduced by John Boehner? When I think John Boehner and pledge, I think Lemon PledgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½brings out woodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s natural shine! Well, the plan was unveiled today by Boehner at a lumber company in Virginia! Honestly. John, we told you never to pose in front of wood! Your complexion makes you blend right in. A lumber company? Perfect. I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think of a better place to present a bunch of dead wood.
