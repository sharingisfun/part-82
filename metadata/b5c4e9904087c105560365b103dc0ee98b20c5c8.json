Sadly, &quot;The Project&quot; has never been released on DVD or BluRay, and this rare rip is the only one I've encountered on the internet. Unfortunately, no subtitles included. If anyone could fix subtitles for it, it would be very appreciated!\n\n[ /Note from Uploader ]\n\n\n**************\n\nBroadcast dates: BBC One on Sunday 10 and Monday 11 November 2002.\n&quot;DW Staff Approved&quot;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thebox.bz/forums.php?action=viewtopic&amp;topicid=7797&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thebox.bz/forums.php?action=viewtopic&amp;topicid=7797&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDescription.\n\nOnly for those interested in UK politics of the period (C1992 - 2001), it is an important programme. As usual &quot;the names have been changed&quot; (although you could hardly say to protect the innocent in most cases). The story of how the Labour Party was changed from within after the last of the &quot;Old Labour&quot; leaders, John Smith suddenly died.\n\nSet against the backdrop of real events, the two-part film charts the rise of three archetypal New Labour types - an ambitious Blair babe, a machinating spin doctor and an idealistic special adviser - from 1992 to 2001. Their journey takes us deep into the world of New Labour headquarters in Millbank, and later Downing Street, exposing the machinations behind the party's transformation into the sharp, media-aware voice of professional, middle-England\n\nThe events depicted really happened, &quot;A fictional drama set within a factual framework&quot;, characters names are changed or/and are combined, but it can be interesting matching them to real people if you like a bit of detective work...The filmmakers had to change names etc to avoid getting sued I expect.\n\nFrom the moment they realised this programme was being put together, the New Labour establishment was not amused. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's head of communications, reportedly instructed staff not to co-operate with the makers - something he now denies. \n\nWeb links: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2415083.stm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2415083.stm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/theproject/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/theproject/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0328290/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0328290/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPicture quality is not great but is watchable, the capture is not mine but from 2 DVD-Rs that came my way, obviously these were made from VHS tape.\n\nTotlal run time, about 210 minutes, split as two x 700Mb files, info for which is typically;\nFormat               : AVI\nFormat/Info          : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat/Family        : RIFF\nFile size            : 700 MiB\nPlayTime             : 1h 48mn\nBit rate             : 900 Kbps\nWriting application  : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library      : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo \nCodec                : DivX 5\nCodec/Family         : MPEG-4\nPlayTime             : 1h 48mn\nBit rate             : 754 Kbps\nWidth                : 352 pixels\nHeight               : 240 pixels\nDisplay Aspect ratio : 1.467\nFrame rate           : 25.000 fps\nResolution           : 8 bits\nChroma               : 4:2:0\nInterlacement        : Progressive\n\nAudio \nCodec                : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nCodec profile        : Joint stereo\nPlayTime             : 1h 48mn\nBit rate             : 128 Kbps\nBit rate mode        : CBR\nChannel(s)           : 2 channels\nSampling rate        : 48 KHz\nResolution           : 16 bits\nWriting library      : LAME3.97 \nEncoding settings    : CBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5c4e9904087c105560365b103dc0ee98b20c5c8","amp;dn":"The+Project+%28BBC+2002%29+VHSrip+-+Parts+1+and+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5c4e9904087c105560365b103dc0ee98b20c5c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,196,233,144,64,135,193,5,86,3,101,177,3,220,14,233,139,32,197,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
