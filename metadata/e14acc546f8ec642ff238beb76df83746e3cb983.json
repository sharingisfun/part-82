It is a song about being trapped in a mistrusting and dysfunctional relationship. Originally, and most notably, a hit for Elvis Presley in 1969, &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; was widely regarded as the single that jump-started Presley's career after his successful '68 Comeback Special. It was his eighteenth and last number-one single in the United States. Rolling Stone later ranked it #91 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 1986, the band Fine Young Cannibals' cover version of the song, which featured backing vocals by Jimmy Somerville, reached #8 on the UK Singles chart.\n       &quot;She Drives Me Crazy&quot; is a song recorded by the Fine Young Cannibals, included on their 1989 album &quot;The Raw and the Cooked&quot;. The song peaked at #5 in the band's native UK in January 1989 before hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. on April 15, 1989. It also made number 3 on the Dutch Top 40.

Fine Young Cannibals portrayed a nightclub band in the movie, performing this song and three others (including the single's b-side &quot;Social Security&quot;). The film is set in Baltimore in 1963, and the song's retro-soul style is consistent with that setting.\n       &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; is a song by Fine Young Cannibals. It was released as the third single from the band's 1989 album &quot;The Raw and the Cooked&quot;.

The song peaked at number 10 on the Canadian Singles Chart in October.
