Online Product Activation is not designed to circumvent the terms of the license, those terms remain the same as ever.\n\n\nVersion : 3.48 \nPlatform : All\nFile Name : SandboxieInstall.exe\n\nMD5  6ec46889864013a525080e676e60d88b\nSHA1 80193c8d466f79f0ffeb0dbbfac2b3e285192435\n\n\n-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcb5549f659fdf23117fb1dfba739a0363ec0d73","amp;dn":"Sandboxie+v3.48","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcb5549f659fdf23117fb1dfba739a0363ec0d73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,181,84,159,101,159,223,35,17,127,177,223,186,115,154,3,99,236,13,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
