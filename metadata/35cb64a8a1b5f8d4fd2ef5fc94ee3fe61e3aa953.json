This will be even if we survive the biggest genocide of history, calculated multiplying probability and victims: 66% x 6.6 billions=4.4 billions, 1000 times the Holocaust. The experiment will start in 45 days now. We might be living the last month of our existence as individuals and as a species. This Fall can be indeed the Fall of Man. And yet, the experiment is not stopped. This machine is too big to fail.

Both Wagner and Wilczek were the first scientists to warn about the future dangers of Super-colliders in their landmark letters to Scientific American in 1999).\n\n\n\n\n\nHow it Will Happen: Earthquakes, Strangelets and Black Holes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the graph, for the first time in History mankind has built a machine-weapon, able to destroy this planet. The LHC is an accelerator, a type of machine evolved during the cold war to rehearse small nuclear explosions, which could be used by the military as a sample of future Nuclear Bombs, and by researchers to explore the simplest forms of energy and particles that compose the Universe. After the cold war ended, Russia and America put an end to the astronomical costs of those machine-weapons, but Europe, with the new ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“marketingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“peaceful useÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (similar to our ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“peace forcesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“humanitarian missionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in Afghanistan) took the industry of accelerators a step further. The result is the Large Hadron Collider, a 7 teravolt, superconductive, superfluid ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“quark cannonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. which will mass together the densest, most attractive substance of the Universe, quarks, to explore the formation of quark-gluon liquids, the explosives, responsible of cosmic annihilations, such as Novas, Super-novas and perhaps the hypothetical big-bang of the Universe.\n\nThe irresponsibility of CERNÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s physicists who plan to do those experiments with quark liquid explosives here on Earth, without even the slightest military or political supervision, has been denounced in Courts and Internet blogs, to not avail, since the LHC is a machine ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“too big to failÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, defended by technocrats, nuclear industries/ physicists and the corporate press, with the same zeal they defended nuclear weapons during the cold war, when that name was still ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“politically correctÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.  Now we have proofs that the European Company of Nuclear Research has been lying to the public about the probabilities of those catastrophic scenarios. In those internal documents CERN affirms that the LHC has enough potency to create strangelets, a strange liquid explosive that is responsible of the ice-9 reaction that converts stars into Super-novas. The Company has even a machine, CASTOR, for Centauro and STrangelet detecTOR, built to study them. Since the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Castor TeamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ affirms the LHC will ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“likelyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ create stable strangelets this 11/9. In the graph, we observe the entire range of LHCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s potency and the type of quark explosives this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“quark cannonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, the layman name this machine should have, will produce. Strangelets are made of usd quarks, deconfined in lead to lead collisions starting 11/9/2010ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nRead More Here &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.cerntruth.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.cerntruth.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n                          &lt;a href=&quot; http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/lhc-results-0205.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/lhc-results-0205.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCERN LHC Black Holes and Strangelets - May Appear Years Later and Destroy World\nDr. Walter L. Wagner discusses the potential destruction of our planet earth by creating micro black holes and strangelets with the LHC. He indicates the current CERN safety reports are seriously flawed and contain unacceptable risks.\n\nFor example, if micro black holes are created, which CERN estimates about 1 micro black hole every second, the effects of this experiment may be months to years after the first LHC collisions.\n\nThese people in charge of the LHC lack self-preservation instincts in similar way, like many sectarians. No evidence or theory would convince them about LHC disaster, until it really happens...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum Roulette : Feature 84 mins\n\nThe Nuclear Industry evolves the final weapon, a quark canon that will produce mass-bombs and could cause the big bang of Earth into a nova (pulsar or black hole). But physicists are in denial, protecting a 13 billion $ machine &amp; scholar ambitions. They lied to a naive press, saying quarks are harmless, cosmic rays, and the canon will find the origin of the Universe. And now are ready to play a game of Russian Roulette with Earth.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThese are open bittorrent trackers, so yes anyone can announce anything on\nthem, please include them in all your torrents.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://concen.cc/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://concen.cc/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://concen.cc/announce &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://umunu.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://umunu.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://umunu.com/announce &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://umu.mu/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://umu.mu/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://umu.mu/announce\n\nSend tips to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;95fffaf0f7f9fae2d5e0f8e0fbe0bbf6faf8&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; or call skype:joeblowman\t\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35cb64a8a1b5f8d4fd2ef5fc94ee3fe61e3aa953","amp;dn":"%5Bconcen.cc%5D+Cern+has+scheduled+a+possable+extinction+level+event","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35cb64a8a1b5f8d4fd2ef5fc94ee3fe61e3aa953","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,203,100,168,161,181,248,212,253,46,245,252,148,238,63,230,30,58,169,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
