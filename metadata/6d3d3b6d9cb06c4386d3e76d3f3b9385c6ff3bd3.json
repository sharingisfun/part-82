This is a mini-image that you mount in a virtual drive in order to play the game without a No-CD crack.  A No-CD crack will not allow you to join an online server at all.  At least with the mini-image, you can join servers that are running in LAN mode.  You still operate the client from INTERNET mode and you need to know the IP address (or domain name) of the server. LAN games will not show up in the game list.\n\nWithin the game, select MULTIPLAYER, then INTERNET, then ADD SERVER.  In the box, enter the IP or domain name of the server.  Click JOIN SERVER.\n\nAt the time of this posting, I have a Co-Op server running you can try this on. Enter this URL:\n\nwhen you start the game, it may ask you to insert any Battlefield 1942 CD.  Just click OK.\n\nI made this mini image and have tested it on Windows XP Pro SP3 using Alcohol 120% version 1.9.8 Build 7421.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d3d3b6d9cb06c4386d3e76d3f3b9385c6ff3bd3","amp;dn":"Battlefield+1942+Mini+Image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d3d3b6d9cb06c4386d3e76d3f3b9385c6ff3bd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,61,59,109,156,176,108,67,134,211,231,109,63,59,147,133,198,255,59,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
