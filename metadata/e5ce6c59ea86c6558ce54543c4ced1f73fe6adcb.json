But then there are bands like A New Found Glory who pull out all the right hooks and harmonies that the hope of bands maintaining a &quot;energetic, sensitive, and happy&quot; tone will remain. A New Found Glory are all about reminiscing about the days of walking to the beach, holding hands with a loved one while loudly singing Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller.&quot; They're all about making mix tapes and anonymously sending it to that special someone. But they're also about trying to pick up the pieces of a shattered relationship by writing a song about it. Also making the moments on Nothing Gold Can Stay is that it doesn't cross that line where you want to scream into the stereo &quot;get over it!&quot; Instead, you just sit back, listen, and relate to their heartfelt days of love lost and found.\n\nSource: CD\nReleased: 1999\nLabel: Drive-Thru Records\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Alternative, Pop\nQuality: FLAC\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
