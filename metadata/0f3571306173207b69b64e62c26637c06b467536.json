Although known for other interests including football and politics, George Leroy Phang's love for and knowledge of music runs very deep as well. Growing up in Trench Town he was exposed to some of the best talent Jamaican music had to offer, being a frequent patron of dances featuring sound systems such as Sir Coxsone Downbeat. During the late 1970s a phenomenonal growth took place in reggae music internationally and Phang developed a close association with Sly &amp; Robbie, the legendary 'Riddim Twins'. This drum and bass partnership were at the forefront of the Kingston studio scene and played on a great portion of the tunes then being released. While spending a lot of time with Robbie in particular at the iconic Channel One studio, the legendary bass player took note of Phang's amazing ear for music. He picked up many recording techniques and ideas along the way which he then parlayed into a career as producer.\n\nBy the early 80s dancehall fever was in the air and Sly &amp; Robbie continued to create brilliant new sounds that enhanced and pushed reggae more and more towards the digital era. Not only did they play for their very own Taxi label but also for Lewis &amp; Marshall's Sun Set, Philip 'Fattis' Burrell's Vena and amongst a few others George Phang's Power House imprint. Power House featured some of the most progressive riddim tracks built by the duo, bringing together classic familiar sounds from the past and adding an extra punch that gave the material featured on the label a very unique sound. The 'Final Mission'-riddim utilized for Half Pint's raggamuffin anthem &quot;Greetings&quot; - the song most synonymous with the producer George Phang - is a case in point. A classic Studio One instrumental by trombone virtuoso Vin Gordon named 'Heavenless' reconstructed to mash up the place inna dancehall style.\n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still a heavy reliance on electronic riddims but the production is up to Taxi standards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ no Casios in sight and, in the case of raggamuffin pioneer Half Pint, the vibes are entirely righteous. His &quot;Greetings&quot; literally demolishes dancehall crowds. It becomes an instant classic and a raggamuffin anthem and manages to put Sly and Robbie back on top. On recording &quot;Greetings&quot; Robbie insists that SlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique drumming is inspired by fellow artist Josey WalesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ dancing in the studio. Sly points to PhangÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s instruction for the inspiration: &quot;George Phang say 'bwoy Sly, play some drum that when you go to dance it mek people fire gun and all that.' He was conducting the session and listening to all these rolls I was making and he was walking up and down the studio and come back to me and say 'ya man, mek the rolls longer.' So I was playing off his inspiration.&quot;\n\nThe only way to do justice in this review to this immaculate 80 tune 4CD &quot;George Phang ~ Power House Selector's Choice Vol.1&quot; collection and the second volume &quot;George Phang ~ Power House Selector's Choice Vol.2&quot; would be by offering soundsamples of all the tunes. As that's not possible I'll just recommend this 4CD-box with its nice cover and booklet by telling you that besides one-off recordings for George Phang by Johnny Osbourne, Echo Minott, Pinchers, Conroy Smith, Al Campbell, Admiral Bailey, Tenor Saw and Nitty Gritty\n(who together appear on the recently released &quot;17 North Parade Presents ~ Tenor Saw Meets Nitty Gritty&quot; on which their 8 tracks George Phang produced album is re-released with an additional 8 track - for other producers -) it has several tunes by Power House favourites Frankie Paul, Peter Metro, Sugar Minott, Little John, Charlie Chaplin, some of the best tunes on vinyl (back then, CD now) by Josey Wales, Yellowman, Barrington Levy, Michael 'Lickshot' Palmer, Toyan, Leroy Smart and of course Half Pint.\n\nAnd if you realize that all these artists voiced brilliant relicks laid by (mainly) Sly &amp; Robbie of classic (especially Studio One) riddims inna dancehallstylee like Lester Sterling's 'African Beat', 'The Answer' a.k.a. Slim Smith' 'Never Let Go', the Heptones' 'Baby', 'Bobby Babylon' a.k.a. 'One Step Beyond', Peter Tosh &amp; The Wailers 'Burial', 'Can't Dweet', 'Curly Locks', the mighty 'Cuss Cuss', 'Darker Shade Of Black', 'Death In The Arena', 'Declaration Of Rights', 'First Cut Is The Deepest', 'He Prayed' a.k.a. 'Dub Organizer', 'Heart Breaker', 'Stylee', 'Hypocrites', 'I'm Just A Guy', 'Java', 'Lecturer', 'Let's Move', the original 'Level The Vibes'-riddim and 'Love Me Forever' you will surely understand that this is a phenomenal release. But the most exciting part of this &quot;Volume 1&quot; is the 10 tune version excursion over 'Heavenless', starting of course with Half Pint's seminal &quot;Greetings&quot; and featuring Little John's Brook Benton cover &quot;True Confession&quot; over the alternative version of the 'Heavenless'-riddim as well. This compilation, organizing 80 tunes from the early days of dancehall by riddim, is one half of the most complete retrospective of gems released on George Phang's Power House label,\n\n\nSo Here It Is ................\n\n\n\nTrack list\n\n\nDisc 1\n'African Beat / Mission Impossible'-riddim\n\nMission - Johnny Osbourne\nFP Love - Frankie Paul\nHackle The Mike - Peter Metro\nDon't Hurt My Feelings - Freddie McGregor\nMission Impossible - Sly &amp; Robbie\n'Answer'-riddim\n\nFeel The Rydim - Sugar Minott\nOld Fire Stick - Frankie Jones\nBummy Bummy - Little John\nDJ A Dance - Charlie Chaplin\nAnswer Version - Sly &amp; Robbie\n'Baby'-riddim\n\nName And Number - Little John\nCome Watch The Sound - Josey Wales\nSkank Quadrille - Yellowman\n'Bobby Babylon'-riddim\n\nMoney Move - Barrington Levy\nTidal Wave - Frankie Paul\nDon't Push Me - Michael Palmer\nDJ Crowd - Toyan\nWalking Jewelry Store - Yellowman\n'Burial'-riddim\n\nLiving Is Hard - Half Pint\nReason Wid De Entertainer - Charlie Chaplin\nDisc 2\n'Can't Dweet'-riddim\n\nSuffer The Little Children - Barrington Levy\nJah Don't Love That - Half Pint\nTry To Hypnotise Me - Echo Minott\nCan't Dweet - Sly &amp; Robbie\n'Curly Locks'-riddim\n\nI Feel Free - Barrington Levy\nHold Me - Frankie Paul\n'Cuss Cuss'-riddim\n\nStrong Sensi - Little John\nSkin Up - Charlie Chaplin\nCuss Cuss - Yellowman\n'Darker Shade Of Black'-riddim\n\nLone Ranger\nAnd Tonto - Tenor Saw\nLove Life - Leroy Smart\nRockers Master - Sugar Minott\n'Death In The Arena'-riddim\n\nCan't Cross The Border - Sugar Minott\nChief In A Town - Michael Palmer\nSing On - Little John\nOne Big Family - Half Pint\nA No One Of Me - Josey Wales\n'Declaration Of Rights'-riddim\n\nBelieve In Jah - Leroy Smart\nThank You Jah - Sugar Minott\nEverything You Try - Nitty Gritty\nDisc 3\n'First Cut Is The Deepest'-riddim\n\nBrother Love - Half Pint\nDon't Distress - Pinchers\nMiami Vice - Charlie Chaplin\n'He Prayed'-riddim\n\nMusic Is The Staff Of Life - Frankie Paul\nMisunderstanding - Barrington Levy\nNah Go To South Africa - Sugar Minott\n'Heart Breaker'-riddim\n\nHeart Breaker - Half Pint\n'Heavenless / Final Mission'-riddim\n\nGreetings - Half Pint\nIndian Lady - Conroy Smith\nAlesha - Frankie Paul\nNo Problem - Peter Metro\nOne A Way Soldier - Al Campbell\nThe Final Mission - Sly &amp; Robbie\nA Who Dem A Try Fe Fool - Admiral Bailey\n'Heavenless / True Confession'-riddim\n\nTrue Confession - Little John\nA True - Sugar Minott\nQue Dem - Charlie Chaplin\n'Stylee'-riddim\n\nShe Give Me Fever - Michael Palmer\nStylee - Frankie Jones\nStylee Version - Sly &amp; Robbie\nDisc 4\n'Hypocrites'-riddim\n\nHey Lady - Half Pint\nCan't Get We Out - Sugar Minott\nJosey Ready - Josey Wales\n'I'm Just A Guy'-riddim\n\nOld King Cole - Sugar Minott\nShe No Ready - Little John\nWhat A Thing - Toyan\n'Java'-riddim\n\nEverytime I Hear The Sound - Josey Wales\nLong Lost Lover - Half Pint\n'Lecturer'-riddim\n\nString Up The Sound - Frankie Paul\nHaul &amp; Galong - Frankie Jones\nBank Account - Leroy Smart\nLecturer Version - Sly &amp; Robbie\n'Let's Move'-riddim\n\nFrontline - Sugar Minott\nSweet Reggae Music (You Have Fe Move) - Echo Minott\nGi Mi Wha Mi Want - Michael Palmer\nHard To Believe - Barrington Levy\n'Level The Vibes'-riddim\n\nLevel The Vibes - Half Pint\nCode Of Conduct - Josey Wales\n'Love Me Forever'-riddim\n\nLove I Can Feel - Josey Wales\nBlow Saxophone - Yellowman\n\n\n\nEnjoyyyyyyyyyyyyy and Seed ..............","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f3571306173207b69b64e62c26637c06b467536","amp;dn":"George+Phang+%7E+Power+House+Selector%5C%27s+Choice+Vol.+1+%28+flac+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f3571306173207b69b64e62c26637c06b467536","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,53,113,48,97,115,32,123,105,182,78,98,194,102,55,192,107,70,117,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
