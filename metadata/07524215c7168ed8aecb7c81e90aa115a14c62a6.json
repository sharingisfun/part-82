From the remote valley of Ennerdale, she starts the ascent to one of Wainwright's favourite fells - Pillar. The route takes her past cliffs, along ledges and over the Lake District's most famous crag, Pillar Rock.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07524215c7168ed8aecb7c81e90aa115a14c62a6","amp;dn":"Wainwright+Walks+-+S02E06+-+Pillar.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07524215c7168ed8aecb7c81e90aa115a14c62a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,82,66,21,199,22,142,216,174,203,124,129,233,10,161,21,161,76,98,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
