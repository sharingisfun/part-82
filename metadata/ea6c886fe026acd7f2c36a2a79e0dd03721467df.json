However, Unreported World finds a country still gripped by terror and violence.\n\nReporter Ramita Navai and director Alex Nott film undercover to investigate claims that gems from one of the world's biggest diamond fields are being used by Robert Mugabe's Zanu PF party to entrench their hold on power by buying the military's loyalty.\n\nThis is against a backdrop of human rights abuses, which victims say are being perpetrated by the military and the police.\n\nThe vast natural resources found in Marange could potentially change the fortunes of a country whose economy is in dire straits, and where poverty, hunger and disease are rampant.\n\nBut Unreported World shows that despite the coalition government, Zimbabwe is a country still plagued by corruption and violence, presenting a serious warning of what is to come ahead of the 2011 elections.\n\n\nFile Name .............: Unreported World S20E05 - Zimbabwe's Blood Diamonds (29 October 2010)[PDTV(XviD)].avi\n\n\n\n\nSource: http://www.thebox.bz/details.php?id=135751\nUpped by geclipse, with thanks\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea6c886fe026acd7f2c36a2a79e0dd03721467df","amp;dn":"Unreported+World+-+Zimbabwe%5C%27s+Blood+Diamonds+2010+10+29+Ch+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea6c886fe026acd7f2c36a2a79e0dd03721467df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,108,136,111,224,38,172,215,242,195,106,42,121,224,221,3,114,20,103,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
