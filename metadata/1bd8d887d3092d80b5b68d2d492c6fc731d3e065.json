Ram and Rahim were two different characters \nplaying role of secret agents.\nIn most of the stories their job will be to save the world from a wicked scientist\nor an enemy of their nation. A typical story will feature their mission to bring \nback a stolen secret file from the villain's den, before it reaches the enemy nation.\nThe choice of character's name as Ram and Rahim was also contributing towards religious\nharmony among children. According to one volume namely Vatann ke Dushman Rahim is \nthe son of a Pakistani colonel who defected to India after he got disillusioned by \nfanaticism of Pakistani armed forces, especially an officer named Fanneh Khan. \nRam is the eldest son of a highly placed Indian Intelligence beaurecrat.\nRam is a Hindu name while Rahim is a Muslim name. Both will have tremendous friendship \nand both will work together to save the world.\nThey have a enemy named Dr. Fomanchu.\nIn later stories, Rahim loses his one hand and has to make do with a prosthetic arm \nthat has the same capabilities as a normal hand, but much stronger and faster.\nChildren used to wait for summer holidays in the late 80s and early 90s for special \neditions of Ram-Rahim's and Crookbond's comics during summer holidays.\n\nCOMICS LIST:\n\n026 Lohe Ke Shaitan.pdf\t12.29 MB\n027 Ironman aur Ram Rahim.pdf\t15.20 MB\n028 Shaitano Ka Baadshah.pdf\t13.47 MB\n035 Khooni Darinde.pdf\t16.93 MB\n039 Fumanchu The Great.pdf\t6.17 MB\n040 Kaliyug Ka Bhagwan.pdf\t6.12 MB\n041 Ek Aankh Wala Shaitaan.pdf\t9.79 MB\n042 Mout Ka Hungama.pdf\t7.20 MB\n043 Fumanchu Ki Parajay.pdf\t7.09 MB\n044 Black File.pdf\t12.55 MB\n045 Khoon Ki Pyaas.pdf\t9.13 MB\n046 Akash Ka Pret.pdf\t15.46 MB\n049 Super 5.pdf\t12.03 MB\n050 Kala tapu.cbr\t6.03 MB\n051 Star-wars.cbr\t5.71 MB\n052 Bhayanak Shaitan.pdf\t13.32 MB\n053 Bhoot preton ka hangama.cbr\t5.52 MB\n054 Laapata Vimaan.cbr\t10.96 MB\n055 Green Land.cbr\t12.88 MB\n056 Katla Ka Abhiyaan.pdf\t6.72 MB\n057 Tabahi Aur Maut.cbr\t7.74 MB\n058 Khooni Samudra.cbr\t13.01 MB\nBONUS COMICS(HAVING SOME MISSING PAGES)/029 Sadabahar Devanand.pdf\t8.85 MB\nBONUS COMICS(HAVING SOME MISSING PAGES)/030 Hawaldar Gendaram Aur Anokha Madari.pdf\t9.70 MB\nBONUS COMICS(HAVING SOME MISSING PAGES)/031 Moam Ki Gudiya.pdf\t8.83 MB\n\n\n\nTHANKS TO THE ORIGINAL UPLOADERS.\nPLEASE COMMENT IF YOU LIKE THEM SO THAT I CAN CONTINUE MY WORK.\nALSO HELP THE NEEDFUL BY SEEDING AS LONG AS YOU CAN.\nTHANKS\n-SANJEET","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bd8d887d3092d80b5b68d2d492c6fc731d3e065","amp;dn":"MANOJ+COMICS+%28HINDI%29+RAM-RAHIM+SET-03","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bd8d887d3092d80b5b68d2d492c6fc731d3e065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,216,216,135,211,9,45,128,181,182,141,45,73,44,111,199,49,211,224,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
