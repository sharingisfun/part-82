By 1974 the line up had changed to the quartet Brotherhood of Man would become most famous for. The group became successful in Europe, before returning to do the same in the UK. After winning the Eurovision Song Contest in 1976, Brotherhood of Man enjoyed three years of hit singles and albums.\nFollowing a decline in sales, the group split, but reformed two years later and are still together today, performing shows throughout Europe. They remain a successful live act in the UK and have occasionally released independently-produced albums.\n\nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks........!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e05446f5fe562c3fab7f6123a29e6b3aef713290","amp;dn":"Brotherhood+Of+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e05446f5fe562c3fab7f6123a29e6b3aef713290","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,84,70,245,254,86,44,63,171,127,97,35,162,158,107,58,239,113,50,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
