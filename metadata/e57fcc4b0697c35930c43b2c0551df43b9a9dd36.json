While fighting a Hollow, an evil spirit that preys on humans who display psychic energy, Rukia attempts to lend Ichigo some of her powers so that he can save his family; but much to her surprise, Ichigo absorbs every last drop of her energy. Now a full-fledged Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo quickly learns that the world he inhabits is one full of dangerous spirits and, along with Rukia--who is slowly regaining her powers--it's Ichigo's job to protect the innocent from Hollows and help the spirits themselves find peace.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e57fcc4b0697c35930c43b2c0551df43b9a9dd36","amp;dn":"Bleach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e57fcc4b0697c35930c43b2c0551df43b9a9dd36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,127,204,75,6,151,195,89,48,196,59,44,5,81,223,67,185,169,221,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
