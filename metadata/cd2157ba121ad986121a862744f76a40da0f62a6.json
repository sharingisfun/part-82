Players start the game by choosing one of the four primary classes: Warrior, Mage, Scout, or Priest. After attaining level 9, the player must choose from two specialized classes associated with their chosen class. Warriors may become a Templar or a Gladiator; Mages may become a Sorcerer or Spirit Master; Scouts choose from Assassin or Ranger; and Priests from Cleric or a Chanter.\n\nUp to six players may form a group, to assist one another in battle, and share the benefits of victory. Certain areas are designed for group play and a group is required to enter some areas in the game. Up to four groups may form an Alliance for situations that call for greater force of numbers.
