It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band's 1975 album A Night at the Opera. The song has no chorus, instead consisting of three main parts - a ballad segment ending with a guitar solo, an operatic passage, and a heavy rock section.\n\nWhen it was released as a single, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; became a huge commercial success, staying at the top of the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks and selling more than a million copies by the end of January 1976. It reached number one again in 1991 for five weeks following Mercury's death, eventually becoming the UK's third best selling single of all time. In the United States the song originally peaked at number nine in 1976; however, it returned to the chart at number two in 1992 following its appearance in the film Wayne's World, reviving its American popularity.\n\nThe single was accompanied by a promotional video, considered ground-breaking. The piece helped establish the visual language of the modern music video. Although critical reaction was initially mixed, particularly in the United States, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; remains one of Queen's most popular songs. Rolling Stone Magazine ranked it as the 163rd greatest song of all time in their 500 Greatest Songs of all Time issue.\n\nThe band was signed to a company called Trillian, who supplied sports coverage for ITV. They hired one of their trucks and got it to Elstree Studios, where the band were rehearsing for their tour. The video was directed by Bruce Gowers, who had directed a video of the band's 1974 performance at the Rainbow Theatre in London, and was recorded by cameraman Barry Dodd and assistant director/floor manager Jim McCutcheon. The video was recorded in just four hours on 10 November 1975, at a cost of Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£4,500. The director said that the band was involved in the discussion of the video and the end result, and &quot;was a co-operative to that extent, but there was only one leader.&quot;\n\nThe video opens with a shot of the four band members in near darkness as they sing the a cappella part. The lights fade up, and the shots cross-fade into close-ups of Freddie. The composition of the shot is the same as Mick Rock's cover photograph for their second album Queen II. The photo, inspired by a photograph of actress Marlene Dietrich, was the band's favourite image of themselves. The video then fades into them playing their instruments. In the opera section of the video, the scene reverts back to the &quot;Queen II&quot; standing positions, after which they perform once again on stage during the hard rock segment. In the closing seconds of the video Roger Taylor is depicted stripped to the waist, striking the tam tam in the manner of the trademark of the Rank Organisation's Gongman, familiar in the UK as the opening of all Rank film productions.\n\nAll of the special effects were achieved during the recording, rather than editing. The visual effect of Mercury's face cascading away (during the echoed line &quot;go&quot;) was accomplished by pointing the camera at a monitor, giving visual feedback, a glare analogous to audio feedback. The honeycomb illusion was created using a shaped lens. The video was edited within five hours because it was due to be broadcast the same week in which it was taped. The film was shipped to the BBC as soon as it was completed and aired for the first time on Top of the Pops in November 1975. After a few weeks at number one, an alternative edit of the video was created. The most obvious difference is the flames superimposed over the introduction as well as several alternate camera angles.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e858d32ec205f3975e05f41a76d473da3938d1b9","amp;dn":"Queen+-+Bohemian+Rhapsody+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e858d32ec205f3975e05f41a76d473da3938d1b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,88,211,46,194,5,243,151,94,5,244,26,118,212,115,218,57,56,209,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
