All the clones are killed in an explosion as Wesker escapes in an aircraft. The original Alice ambushes him, but Wesker injects her with a serum that neutralizes the T-virus in her system, eliminating her superhuman powers and making her human again. Before he can kill her, the aircraft crashes and Alice emerges alone from the wreckage.\n\nMany months later, Alice follows a repeating emergency broadcast from a survivors' safe haven known as &quot;Arcadia&quot;. After many fruitless months searching for Arcadia and finding no survivors along the way, including her friends from the previous film (among them Claire Redfield (Larter) and K-Mart (Locke)), Alice begins to lose hope, believing herself to be the last surviving human on the planet. Stopping on an abandoned beach, Alice finds the helicopter taken by Claire and the others when they and Alice parted ways in the previous film. A crazed Claire, under the influence of an Umbrella Corporation device attached to her chest, attacks her. Alice removes the device, finding that it has damaged Claire's memory. Claire slowly regains bits and pieces, remembering that Umbrella ambushed their group when they landed on the beach, attaching the devices to them, though she managed to escape. *\n\n\n*enjoy ... *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ffc42422258393fb95bcd15fc6c2c4c6e986663","amp;dn":"MOVIE+%C3%82%C2%BB+RESIDENT+EVIL+AFTERLIFE+3D+SUPERCAM+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ffc42422258393fb95bcd15fc6c2c4c6e986663","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,252,66,66,34,88,57,63,185,91,205,21,252,108,44,76,110,152,102,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
