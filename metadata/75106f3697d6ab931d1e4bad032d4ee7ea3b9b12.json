When Justin begins to fall for one of them, a striking, street-smart con-artist named Galaxy, he finds that there are a few people in his life complicating his pursuit of his dream girl: a love-sick police sergeant who happens to be his mom's ex-boyfriend, his 116-year-old grandfather who is the newly minted ? World's Oldest Living Man, his best friend and current employer Wayne Chung, and Galaxy's insanely jealous, belligerent carnie boyfriend Reggie.\n\n\n\nThomas Middleditch ...
