Robinson, Joan Bennett, and Dan Duryea, had earlier appeared together in The Woman in the Window (1944) also directed by Fritz Lang. The three were re-teamed for Scarlet Street.\n\n\n Edward G. Robinson ...  Christopher Cross \n Joan Bennett ...  Katharine 'Kitty' March \n Dan Duryea ...  Johnny Prince \n Margaret Lindsay ...  Millie Ray \n Rosalind Ivan ...  Adele Cross \n Jess Barker ...  David Janeway \n Charles Kemper ...  Patch-eye Higgins \n Anita Sharp-Bolster ...  Mrs. Michaels (as Anita Bolster) \n Samuel S. Hinds ...  Charles Pringle \n Vladimir Sokoloff ...  Pop LeJon \n Arthur Loft ...  Dellarowe \n Russell Hicks ...  J.J. Hogarth \n\nChristopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson), a mild banker and amateur painter is at a dinner honoring him for twenty-five years of service in the bank for which he works. On his way home, he helps Kitty (Joan Bennett), an amoral femme fatale who is apparently being attacked by a man. Soon, he becomes enamored of her because his own domestic life is ruled by his bullying wife Adele (Rosalind Ivan), who idolizes her former husband, a policeman drowned while trying to save a woman.\n\nWhen the film was released, Bosley Crowther, The New York Times film critic, gave the film a mixed review, and wrote, &quot;But for those who are looking for drama of a firm and incisive sort, Scarlet Street is not likely to furnish a particularly rare experience. Dudley Nichols wrote the story from a French original, in which it might well have had a stinging and grisly vitality. In this presentation, however, it seems a sluggish and manufactured tale, emerging much more from sheer contrivance than from the passions of the characters involved. And the slight twist of tension which tightens around the principal character is lost in the middle of the picture when he is shelved for a dull stretch of plot. In the role of the love-blighted cashier Edward G. Robinson performs monotonously and with little illumination of an adventurous spirit seeking air. And, as the girl whom he loves, Joan Bennett is static and colorless, completely lacking the malevolence that should flash in her evil role. Only Dan Duryea as her boy friend hits a proper and credible stride, making a vicious and serpentine creature out of a cheap, chiseling tinhorn off the streets.&quot;\n\nThe staff at Variety magazine gave the film a good review and wrote, &quot;Fritz Lang's production and direction ably project the sordid tale of the romance between a milquetoast character and a gold-digging blonde...Edward G. Robinson is the mild cashier and amateur painter whose love for Joan Bennett leads him to embezzlement, murder and disgrace. Two stars turn in top work to keep the interest high, and Dan Duryea's portrayal of the crafty and crooked opportunist whom Bennett loves is a standout in furthering the melodrama.&quot;\n\nMore recently, critic Dennis Schwartz wrote, &quot;Scarlet Street is a bleak psychological film noir that has the same leading actors as his 1944 film The Woman in the Window. It sets a long-standing trend of a criminal not punished for his crime; this is the first Hollywood film where that happened...The Edward G. Robinson character is viewed as an ordinary man who is influenced by an evil couple who take advantage of his vulnerability and lead him down an amoral road where he eventually in a passionate moment loses his head and commits murder. Chris's imagination can no longer save him from his dreadful existence, and his complete downfall comes about as the talented artist loses track of reality and his dignity.&quot;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:820c3e9ea3a78e8517e983fabc162ec6c8fbbf14","amp;dn":"Scarlet+Street+%5B1945%5D+Fritz+Lang","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"820c3e9ea3a78e8517e983fabc162ec6c8fbbf14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,12,62,158,163,167,142,133,23,233,131,250,188,22,46,198,200,251,191,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
