The book is filled with advises, anecdotes and samples. The only drawback I see is that for advanced user and above there isn't nothing new, maybe only something to learn from the provided games.\n\nJohn Emms reveals the secrets of how to maximize potential and improve results in competitive play. Drawing upon years of his own experience, Emms tackles the all-important practical aspects of chess playing: studying ones own strengths and weaknesses, and those of prospective opponents; concentration and manner at the chessboard; handling time trouble; tackling cheats; playing for a win or a draw; saving difficult positions; avoiding silly mistakes; building an opening repertoire; using chess computers and software; choosing the right tournaments and much more besides.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f56a1abd1033f95605f42a0187c4ae147202e59b","amp;dn":"The+Survival+Guide+to+Competitive+Chess++Improve+Your+Results+No","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f56a1abd1033f95605f42a0187c4ae147202e59b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,106,26,189,16,51,249,86,5,244,42,1,135,196,174,20,114,2,229,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
