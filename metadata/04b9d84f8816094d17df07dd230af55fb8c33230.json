In feudal times various obligations and powers, collectively referred to as the &quot;royal prerogative,&quot; were reserved to the king. The king exercised these functions in his role of father of the country.\n\nIn the United States, the parens patriae doctrine has had its greatest application in the treatment of children, mentally ill persons, and other individuals who are legally incompetent to manage their affairs. The state is the supreme guardian of all children within its jurisdiction, and state courts have the inherent power to intervene to protect the best interests of children whose welfare is jeopardized by controversies between parents. This inherent power is generally supplemented by legislative acts that define the scope of child protection in a state.\n\n\n\nSUBJECT MATTER:\n*Definition of Parens Patriae\n*History of Parens Patriae\n*Feudal Structures\n*Biblical Law\n*Serfdom\n*Marriage Licenses\n*Corporations as People\n*Colonial Statutes\n*Idolatry &amp; The State\n*Too much sodomy (especially in kalifornia)\n*Plant Prohibition (green herbs)\n*Voting for Tyranny\n*Iraq's New Demoncracy\n*Invocation of Parens Patriae\n*Birth Control (aka Poor Control)\n*Democrats &amp; Republicans as 10 plank Communists\n*Who is in Control\n*Public Schooling\n*Parents Rights are Privileges\n*Natural Law\n*We are the Delinquents\n*Parents have a Duty to Educate their Children\n*Trust Indentures\n*Claim your Child\n*10 Commandments or 10 Planks\n\nYear: July 25th, 2008 a.d.\nRuntime: 59:47\nFormat: MP4\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://library.georgegordon.com/whois&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://library.georgegordon.com/whois&lt;/a&gt;\nWho Is George Gordon?\n\nGeorge Gordon is the nation's foremost teacher of pro se courtroom strategy and procedure, a pioneer who taught himself the ins and outs of defending himself in court when Big Brother put him out of business. He is an author, lecturer, father and former corporate president. In 1979, he created Barrister's Inn in Boise, Idaho to teach civil law and courtroom strategy and procedure. In 1985, he moved to Isabella, Missouri, and created George Gordon's School of Law, which has been a leader in teaching individuals to successfully represent themselves in the civil court system.\n\nGeorge's experience over the years includes six cases of his that have gone to the U.S. Supreme Court and numerous others that have gone the distance in various state or federal courts. These have ranged from custody cases involving grandparents' rights, through Title 42 suits over civil rights violations by local or state authorities (one of which was even settled in gold), to cases on personal status. Some have even affected national courtroom procedure such as Gordon v. Idaho, 778 F2d 1397, in which the Federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that an individual no longer has to take an oath or affirmation in court, if his reason for not taking it is based on the fact that the Bible (which they so kindly provide for you to swear on) says that you shouldn't swear oaths. If you add in the cases where students of his were parties to the action, the number goes into the hundreds, if not the thousands. Many questions as to an individual's status and his relationship with various governmental bodies have first been answered in cases involving George or his students.\n\nIn addition to teaching pro se litigation, George is also one of the nation's few teachers of the Mosaic Law. In fact, he is one of the only people in the United States, if not the world, to practice this Law in its entirety. This adherence to a Law and its attendant moral code (which was not done away with, no matter what is being taught in the churches out there) has made George a target of, yet virtually untouched by, both governmental and religious groups--something few people can claim.\n\nGeorge is a subsistence farmer using organic methods to practice land stewardship pursuant to the Scriptural land laws. He and his family are living peacefully in the Ozark Mountains of Missouri and are doing so without any Social Security Numbers, marriage licenses, business permits, insurance, innoculations, bank loans, credit cards, public school, government inspections, in fact, without any government intrusion into their lives. He observes the Mosaic Law and does not advocate, nor teach, anarchy, civil disobedience, or racism.\n\nWhile he has successfully used common law pleadings in both state and federal courts, he is not now, nor has he ever been, associated with the erroneous 'common law courts' that have been springing up over the past few years, nor with such groups as the Montana Freemen or the 'Republic of Texas.' He is an individual and, as such, belongs to no groups. Also, contrary to what has been reported, he is not in hiding, he is not in prison (in fact, he has never been in prison, particularly not over taxes; his only confrontation with the IRS resulted in a win), and (to paraphrase Mark Twain) the reports of his death are greatly exaggerated. He is alive, doing well, and teaching classes in Isabella, Missouri.\n\nJoe Blow recommends these websites: \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.concen.cc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.concen.cc&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.umunu.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.umunu.com&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theinfounderground.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theinfounderground.com&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iamthewitness.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iamthewitness.com&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.wakeupfromyourslumber.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.wakeupfromyourslumber.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSend tips to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;ef85808a8d838098af9a829a819ac18c8082&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; or call skype:joeblowman\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04b9d84f8816094d17df07dd230af55fb8c33230","amp;dn":"Parens+Patriae+-+George+Gordon+%28Law+Material%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04b9d84f8816094d17df07dd230af55fb8c33230","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,185,216,79,136,22,9,77,23,223,7,221,35,10,245,95,184,195,50,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
