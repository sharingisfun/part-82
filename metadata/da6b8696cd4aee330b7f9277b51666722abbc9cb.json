It was recorded between February 1 and October 20, 1989 and originally released on October 31, 1989.\n\nThe album was released on CD in 1989 by Arista Records before being rereleased in 2000 by BMG International. It was then remastered, expanded, and released as part of the Beyond Description (1973-1989) 12-CD box set in October 2004. The remasted version was later released separately on CD on April 11, 2006 by Rhino Records.\n\nThis album features the most songs by keyboard player Brent Mydland, who has four song credits in collaboration with Dead lyricist John Perry Barlow. This mirrored accurately Mydland's increasing vocal presence in the band over the decade he spent with the Dead. His death less than a year later would prove to end the Dead's studio album tenure.\n\nThe Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in the San Francisco Bay Area. The band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, country, jazz, psychedelia, and space rockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and for live performances of long musical improvisation. &quot;Their music,&quot; writes Lenny Kaye, &quot;touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.&quot;\n\nThe fans of the Grateful Dead, some of whom followed the band from concert to concert for years, are known as &quot;Deadheads&quot; and are known for their dedication to the band's music. Many referred to the band simply as &quot;the Dead&quot;. As of 2003, the remaining band members have toured under the name &quot;The Dead.&quot; Remaining band members Bob Weir and Phil Lesh formed &quot;Furthur&quot; in 2009. Drummer Bill Kreutzmann formed 7 Walkers with Malcolm &quot;Papa Mali&quot; Welbourne in 2009. The Grateful Dead's musical influences varied widely; in concert recordings or on record albums one can hear psychedelic rock, blues, rock and roll, country-western, bluegrass, country-rock, and improvisational jazz. These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead &quot;the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world.&quot; They were ranked 55th in the issue The Greatest Artists of all Time by Rolling Stone magazine.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da6b8696cd4aee330b7f9277b51666722abbc9cb","amp;dn":"The+Grateful+Dead+-+Just+A+Little+Light+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da6b8696cd4aee330b7f9277b51666722abbc9cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,107,134,150,205,74,238,51,11,127,146,119,181,22,102,114,42,187,201,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
