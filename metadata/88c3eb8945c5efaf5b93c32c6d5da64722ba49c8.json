Michael basks in the  \n                    luxury of Holby Care, leaving Penny in the  \n                    lurch on the frontline on AAU. But with Hanssen  \n                    arriving on AAU just in time to witness the  \n                    mess, Michael realises he may have pushed his  \n                    luck.

More  \n                    nervous than ever in Hanssen's presence,  \n                    Elizabeth is worried about making a mistake.  \n                    With Ric's help, Elizabeth hopes to swing  \n                    things her way, but will it be enough to secure  \n                    Hanssen's good opinion and secure her job?  \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        First release was undersized.\n                        \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88c3eb8945c5efaf5b93c32c6d5da64722ba49c8","amp;dn":"Holby.City.S13E02.REPACK.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88c3eb8945c5efaf5b93c32c6d5da64722ba49c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,195,235,137,69,197,239,175,91,147,195,44,109,93,166,71,34,186,73,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
