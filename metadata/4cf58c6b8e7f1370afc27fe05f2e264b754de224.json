It concentrates on &quot;desktop&quot; use so that it is ready for internet, multimedia, document and general home use out of the box. Absolute is lightweight -- meaning 2 things: that it can run on on older hardware and that the OS interface stays out of your way.\nIt is version-compatible with Slackware so you can use almost any package from the same version of Slack on Absolute. Development libraries (headers) for everything installed are always included, so you can code and/or build almost anything from source.\nIt is what I use all day, every day, and I am very thankful for Linux and Slackware and I hope others find benefit from my work on Absolute.\n--Paul Sherman'\n\nAbsolute 13.1.41 released\nSunday, 08/08/2010:\nMultimedia Installer corrected. Want a release not to need a download to correct... also Chrome browser updated (v6.0.482.0, again compiled on Absolute with gecko-mediaplayer plugin enabled) and with 2 plugins pre-packaged (PDF reader and extensions buttton.) Also a slew of updates originating from the Slackware repo.\n\nChangelog : http://www.absolutelinux.org/changelog.shtml\n\nmd5sum : bd811969c3ec99732cb7ff9a0ba53f74  absolute-13.1.41.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cf58c6b8e7f1370afc27fe05f2e264b754de224","amp;dn":"absolute-13.1.41.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cf58c6b8e7f1370afc27fe05f2e264b754de224","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,245,140,107,142,127,19,112,175,194,127,224,95,46,38,75,117,77,226,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
