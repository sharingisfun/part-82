Khalezov, a former officer the Soviet nuclear intelligence, officially known as the Special Control Service of the 12th Chief Directorate of the Defense Ministry, concerning the nuclear demolition of the World Trade Center. This was posted onbut is no longer available. The interview is divided into 26 parts of about 10 minutes each, with MPEG-4 encoding.\n \nNuclear demolition of skyscrapers was a new concept of a broader term of controlled demolition that first appeared at the end of 60s, when it became necessary to provide some satisfactory means of how to demolish modern tall steel frame buildings in order to meet necessary requirements set by a building code. \n\nMr. Khalezov's web sites are: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dkhalezov.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dkhalezov.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nuclear-demolition.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nuclear-demolition.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nuclear-demolition-wikipedia.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nuclear-demolition-wikipedia.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUpgrade: I've added some videos from Dimitri's sites, his groundbreaking book &quot;The Third Truth about 9/11&quot;, the deleted wikipedia article and some other items.\n\nComment: \n\nDimitri's videos onhave been removed under a flimsy pretext. The wikipedia article Dimitri Khalezov wrote for wikipedia was written in a very non-conspiratorial way, and it didn't even mention 9/11. It was an unbiased and scientific article, nevertheless it was removed from wikipedia after a brief period of time. Isn't it interesting how tolerantand wikipedia are in respect to all the nonsensical theories on 9/11, but when someone uploads something of value, then it will be censored. \n\nThis is the ONLY theory on what happened on that fateful day, that makes sense. The idea that you can turn the WTC to dust with the help of nano-thermite is ludicrous, and only a fool would believe the nonsense the Bush-administration wanted us to believe. Most of the public are like little children: They don't want to hear the truth, they're not ready for it, and if you offer truth to them, they just make fun of you, or start hating you. Why should we even bother to bring truth to such a totally ignorant and arrogant public? \n\nOf course, this entire story may also be a clever disinformation plot, devised by the KGB-FSB, because the US administration asked them for some psychological support. What I can say is this: I have never heard of a map, a theory on what happened on 9/11 that was able to explain so many of the well known facts. There is a high probability that Dimitri's theories are true.
