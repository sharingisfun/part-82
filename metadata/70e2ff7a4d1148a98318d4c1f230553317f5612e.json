Good, solid Hard Core music that gets you jumpin around at the local dive. These guys could almost call &quot;The Roche&quot; home for as many times as they've played there, either as The Stranglucis, or any one of the numerous bands each of these guys have been in.\n\nLocal talent kickin' ass.\n\nIf you like it, let me know.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't forget to comment and let the band know what you think, they could always use you're support.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70e2ff7a4d1148a98318d4c1f230553317f5612e","amp;dn":"Stranglucis%2C+The+-+2010+-+The+Stranglucis+%5BEP%5D+%5B192k%5D+%7BFixed%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70e2ff7a4d1148a98318d4c1f230553317f5612e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,226,255,122,77,17,72,169,131,24,212,193,242,48,85,51,23,245,97,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
