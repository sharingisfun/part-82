She has found signs that the girl was being starved, and had even recently given birth. As the two look into the case with the help of Detective Odafin Tutuola and Dr. George Huang, they find that the girl had fallen victim to a human trafficking ring, and though some think it's a case for the FBI, the cops instead reach out to Assistant U.S. Attorney and friend Christine Danielson, who has moved up in the world since the detectives last saw her. Meanwhile, Captain Donald Cragen is frustrated by his crumbling precinct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 ****EOD****\n\n                         Even Firefighters need Heroes\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18a73a4487f6e43e4a339d203424c9cc41c53067","amp;dn":"Law+%26+Order+SVU+S12E04+Merchandise++++++++EoD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18a73a4487f6e43e4a339d203424c9cc41c53067","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,167,58,68,135,246,228,62,74,51,157,32,52,36,201,204,65,197,48,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
