Immediately, one can sense Obersts literate approach. His vocal curdle is abrasive yet warm. Chimes and simple drumming keep the story of personal insecurity and the fear of the unknown coming alive in a dreamy sort of way. Even when he's aching his way through the pop rumble of &quot;Method Acting,&quot; Bright Eyes convincingly lures one into his eclectic musical world. Oberst obviously has the talent to support the hype. &quot;Lover I Don't Have to Love&quot; is a dark number with its Radiohead-like doom and gloom; however, the piano swirl of &quot;A Bowl of Oranges&quot; offers a brighter reflection. On Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground, Bright Eyes has mixed badness with beauty for a sonic storybook that relates to everyone. \n\nSource: CD\nReleased: 2002\nLabel: Saddle Creek Records\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie, Folk\nQuality: FLAC\n\nTracks:\n\n  1.
