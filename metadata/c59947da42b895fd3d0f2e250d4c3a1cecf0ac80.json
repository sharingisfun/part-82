Adrasta keeps  order with the aid of  her\n        Huntsman  and  his  wolfweeds -  mobile  balls  of vegetation \n        - while  a band  of scruffy  thieves, led  by Torvin, organize\n        raids on her palace to steal whatever metal they can.\n\n        The Doctor identifies the distress signal's source as a  large\n        eggshell-like structure in the forest. He is taken prisoner by\n        Adrasta's guards and, in order to escape, leaps into the  Pit \n        - the entrance to a cave system into which all those who incur\n        Adrasta's wrath  are consigned  to be  devoured by  an immense\n        green globular  creature living  within. The  Doctor, with the\n        aid  of the  elderly soothsayer  Organon, discovers  that the\n        creature is not  an unthinking killer  but an ambassador  from\n        the planet Tythonus,  which has a  lack of chlorophyll  but an\n        abundance of metal.\n\n        The Tythonians had hoped to trade with Chloris, but the  first\n        person their ambassador Erato  encountered on arriving in  his\n        eggshell-like  ship  was Adrasta,  who  took his  communicator\n        device  and trapped  him in  the Pit  so as  to preserve  her\n        monopoly on metal. Erato retrieves his communicator and  kills\n        Adrasta.\n\n        He  then  warns the  Doctor  that the  Tythonians  have set  a\n        neutron star on a collision course with Chloris in retaliation\n        for his imprisonment. With the Doctor's help he is freed  from\n        the Pit and, out in space, spins an aluminium shell around the\n        star, allowing for it to be pulled off course by the  TARDIS's\n        gravitational tractor beam and thus saving Chloris.\n\n     \n                                           \n                EPISODE SUMMARY                  \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n        Season 17, Episode 3: The Creature From The Pit Part 1\n\n        The Doctor, in  order to escape  from Adrasta and  her guards,\n        jumps into the Pit.\n\n     \n                                           \n                   RIP NOTES                     \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                                    Enjoy!\n\n     \n                                           \n               GROUP INFORMATION                 \n        9 Years of the Force and still         \n                     going strong                      \n     \n\n        What we are looking for:\n\n        * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n        * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n        * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage\n\n        * If you think you can help contact us on irc,\n        * or email us on &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;55133a273630153d20263d7b343c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c59947da42b895fd3d0f2e250d4c3a1cecf0ac80","amp;dn":"Doctor.Who.S17E03.The.Creature.From.The.Pit.Part.1.DVDRip.XviD-a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c59947da42b895fd3d0f2e250d4c3a1cecf0ac80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,153,71,218,66,184,149,253,61,15,46,37,13,76,58,28,236,240,172,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
