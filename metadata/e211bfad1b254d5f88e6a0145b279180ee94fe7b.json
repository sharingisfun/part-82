There will be a high altitude finishing line at Avoriaz and even if the gaps are not big, Contador should still go on the offensive. He could even get his hands on the Yellow Jersey, but will his team be able to defend it every day? In 2003, Richard Virenque attacked on the Col de la Ramaz pass to win the stage that finished in Morzine and pick up the Yellow Jersey. To find a stage with a finish at Avoriaz, you have to go back sixteen years to 1994. Latvian Piotr Ugrumov, who was the TourÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s runner-up that year, triumphed before winning the following dayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stage as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e211bfad1b254d5f88e6a0145b279180ee94fe7b","amp;dn":"2010+Tour+De+France+%28in+HD%29+-+Stage+8+-+2010-07-11+%28Cycling%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e211bfad1b254d5f88e6a0145b279180ee94fe7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,17,191,173,27,37,77,95,136,230,160,20,91,39,145,128,238,148,254,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
