This quartet was very famous during the period 1930-1960. See also information in WIKIPEDIA. Not of all the songs have a good sound quality. Some songs I recorded it from AFN Bremerhafen on the mediumwave years ago. \n\nSo I hope you will enjoy these songs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d763a9da138b74b7378f12fd9c36386c9541655","amp;dn":"The+Harmonizing+Four+-My+Favourite+Gospelgroup+%5Bku%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d763a9da138b74b7378f12fd9c36386c9541655","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,118,58,157,161,56,183,75,115,120,241,47,217,195,99,134,201,84,22,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
