The galaxy, known as NGC 4911, contains rich lanes of dust and gas near its center. These are silhouetted against glowing newborn star clusters and iridescent pink clouds of hydrogen, the existence of which indicates ongoing star formation. Hubble has also captured the outer spiral arms of NGC 4911, along with thousands of other galaxies of varying sizes. The high resolution of Hubble's cameras, paired with considerably long exposures, made it possible to observe these faint details.\n\nThis natural-color Hubble image, which combines data obtained in 2006, 2007, and 2009 from the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 and the Advanced Camera for Surveys, required 28 hours of exposure time.\n\n\nAbout the Object  \t\nObject Name: \tNGC 4911\nObject Description: \tSpiral Galaxy\nPosition (J2000): \tR.A. 13h 00m 56s.06\nDec. +27Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° 47' 27&quot;.13\nConstellation: \tComa Berenices\nDistance: \t320 million light-years (100 million parsecs)\nDimensions: \tThe image is roughly 2.5 arcminutes (230,000 light-years or 72,000 parsecs) wide.\nAbout the Data \t\nData Description: \tThe image was created from Hubble data from proposals 10842: K. Cook (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), M. Gregg (University of California, Davis), L. Macri (National Optical Astronomy Observatories, AURA), J. Mould (University of Melbourne), P. Stetson (Dominion Astrophysical Observatory), and D. Welch (McMaster University); and 11956: K. Noll, Z. Levay, L. Frattare, C. Christian, F. Hamilton, and H.

Four filters were used to sample broad and narrow wavelength ranges. The color results from assigning different hues (colors) to each monochromatic image.
