Recette Lemongrass finds herself in charge of an item shop built into her house, in order to pay back a loan her father took and then skipped out on - and Tear, her newfound fairy &quot;companion&quot;, won't take no for an answer! As Recette, you have to decide how you'll get your stock - either through playing the markets in town or going out into the wild with an adventuring friend and thrashing beasts until they give up the goodies - how much to sell things for, what the shop should look like, and how to best go about getting the money Tear needs to pay off the loan. If you can't come up with the money... well, hope you like living in a cardboard box.\n\nKey features:\n\nManage all aspects of an item shop ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from stock to interior design!\nExplore randomized dungeons ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ never quite the same twice!\nMultiple adventurers to choose from when dungeon-diving ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ no two play the same!\nPlenty to do after beating the game ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ challenge yourself with Survival Mode or play to your heart's delight in Endless Mode!\nEngaging story, localized by Carpe Fulgur ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ get to know the people of Pensee!\nSystem Requirements\nMinimum:\n\nOS: Windows XP/Vista/7\nProcessor: Pentium 4 1.7ghz or Athlon XP 1700+ (or equivalent processor)\nMemory: 256MB of system RAM (512 reccomended for Windows Vista and 7)\nGraphics: DirectX 8.1-compatible video card of any type with at least 64 megabytes of video RAM; Nvidia and ATI tested (Intel Intregrated Graphics below X4000 series not recommended)\nDirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®: DirectX 8.1\nHard Drive: 700MB free HD space\nSound: DirectX 8.1-compatible sound card/motherboard chip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d42744ba23c229fd71febc43ea50a20cf949a436","amp;dn":"Recettear%3A+An+Item+Shop%5C%27s+Tale","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d42744ba23c229fd71febc43ea50a20cf949a436","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,39,68,186,35,194,41,253,113,254,188,67,234,80,162,12,249,73,164,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
