To mention St. Etienne as a touchstone isn't too far off, especially with Regina singer Iisa Pykari's lilting, sultry delivery, just replace the baggy grooves with more of a jazzy shuffle and some surreal detours. During &quot;Tapaa minut aamulla,&quot; Pykari's exotic melody seems to borrow equally from Western and Far Eastern scales, eventually leading the light, Balearic-kissed song through a storm of cascading piano keys that come down like a summer rain shower. The same piano wrenches up the tension in the skeletal leftfield house-pop of &quot;Saanko jÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ yÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ksi?&quot; and helps steer the album towards slightly darker, more mysterious territory which arrives a few tracks later with &quot;Sinun tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ssÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ salissa,&quot; a song whose sampled sitars and poly-rhythmic pulse recall the Knife on a magic carpet ride. An enjoyably diverse outing, fans of the aforementioned shouldn't hesitate.\n\n-Gerald Hammill\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Vapaus\n2. Tapaa minut aamulla\n3. Totuus minusta\n4.
