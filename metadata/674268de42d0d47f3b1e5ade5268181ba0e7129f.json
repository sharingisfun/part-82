But just as he's about to take the shot, he notices someone aiming at him\nand realizes he's been set up. He barely survives the sniper's bullet, and is soon out\nfor revenge on his former employers, with the reluctant assistance of his old friend\nCheech Marin, who has become a priest and taken a vow of nonviolence. If you hire\nhim to take out the bad guys, make sure the bad guys aren't you!  Written by\nrmlohner\n\nThree years ago in Mexico, determined Federale Machete (Danny Trejo) is betrayed\nand set-up by his boss, resulting in his wife and child being murdered by drug kingpin\nTorrez (Steven Seagal). Now, in Texas, Machete resurfaces when hired to\nassassinate Senator McLaughlin (Robert De Niro), an extreme advocate against illegal\nimmigration. Once again betrayed and set-up, Machete plots his revenge against the\nmen who've wronged him with the help of resistance fighter Luz (Michelle Rodriguez),\nICE Agent Sartana (Jessica Alba), and the shotgun-toting Padre (Cheech Marin).\n\nDanny Trejo...
