Cobbs rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible-inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/&lt;/a&gt;\nMOVIEmeter: Up 300% in popularity this week.\nUser Rating:Top 250: #3 (register to vote) 9.3/10\n\n\n \nVideo:\nCodec:::::::::::::::: XviD\nDuration::::::::::::: 2Hour 19Minutes\nBitrate:::::::::::::: 1266 Kbps\nWidth:::::::::::::::: 640\nHeight::::::::::::::: 256\nFrame Rate::::::::::: 25.000 FPS\nSize::::::::::::::::: 1.37GB\nLanguage::::::::::::: English\nSubtitles:::::::::::: None\nVideo Source::::::::: Russian DVD From a old friend.

Anyway we got better audio last night...this sounds alot\nmore crisp, and not as hollow, we filtered it so it sounds pretty good audio. The 1st 7 minutes of the audio were \nvery very fuzzy, so we added the line audio from our previous release, which was also good and the rest is new audio..\nwe re did the video lowering the orange a bit more, and trying to bring a little more colour into the other scenes instead\nof it looking dull. Added a sharpness and video denoise filters and a lot more. Overall this is a good movie from what ive\nsaw of it so far. Enjoy better release with better audio \n========================================================\n\n\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.com/image/19000/18919.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.com/image/19000/18919.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0066b84261cd5833f301419f95a986569670caec","amp;dn":"Inception.2010.TS.V2.NEW.AUDIO.XviD-PrisM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0066b84261cd5833f301419f95a986569670caec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,102,184,66,97,205,88,51,243,1,65,159,149,169,134,86,150,112,202,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
