They received critical and popular acclaim internationally.\n\nThe Sugarcubes formed on June 8, 1986, the day that vocalist BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk  (born BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk GuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â°mundsdottir) gave birth to her son, Sindri Eldon; another member of the Sugarcubes, ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³r Eldon, is his father. Before that day, the members of the group had been a variety of Icelandic bands. BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk had the longest career out of any of the members. When she was 11 years old, the vocalist had recorded a children's album. In her late teens, she joined the Icelandic post-punk band Tappi Tikarrass, who released two albums before splitting in 1983. Drummer Siggi Baldursson (born Sigtryggur Baldursson, October 2, 1962) was a member of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¾eyr (aka Theyr), whose most prominent international moment came in 1982, when they recorded with Youth and Jaz Coleman of Killing Joke. At the same time Theyr was popular within Iceland, Einar Benediktsson and Bragi Olafesson formed a punk band called Purrkur Pillnikk, which released records on Benediktsson's own label, Gramm. By 1984, BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk, Benediktsson, and Baldursson had joined forces, forming KUKL  with keyboardist Einar Mellax. KUKL ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which means witch in Icelandic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ was a noisy, artsy post-punk band that released several singles on the independent British record label Crass. In 1986, KUKL evolved into the Sugarcubes, adding BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk's then-husband ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³r Eldon on guitar and Bragi Olafesson on bass.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f87882e97627f0035035e5375d0e658b9f20081","amp;dn":"The+Sugarcubes+-+Motorcrash+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f87882e97627f0035035e5375d0e658b9f20081","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,135,136,46,151,98,127,0,53,3,94,83,117,208,230,88,185,242,0,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
