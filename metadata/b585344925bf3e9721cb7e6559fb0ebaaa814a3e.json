He has been sent into the Mexican border city of Los Toros and its surroundings by his twin brother Tommy, who wants him to find out who killed their father Ernesto. The player will be tasked with infiltrating and taking down the biggest drug cartel in Mexico and battling it out with dope dealers, banditos, corrupt Federales and Mexican Army, loco luchadores, guerillas, and other assorted bad guys. Between story missions the player can do optional challenge missions as he or she wishes, exploring Los Toros and gathering bonuses to rack up a high score.\n\nAt the beginning, the player assumes the role as Ernesto Cruz, the boys' father. After Ernesto and the DEA attack the military in the jungle to take some info on Papa Muerte, Ernesto is thrown from the plane and killed. Colonel (Commander) Trust believes it's a drug overdose, however, Tommy suspects an agent. In second mission you are Tommy. Tommy meets Marco, who is his primary contact with Morales Cartel. Then Tommy destroys Virgillo gang convoy and their gas station, but is seriously wounded. His twin brother Ramiro takes the job. While searching who is responsible for his father's death, he will have to kill, befriend and interrogate many banditos, gangsters and drug dealers to get to the truth.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--------Characters--------\n    * Ramiro &quot;Ram&quot; Cruz: The playable character for most of the game. A second generation Mexican-American from Venice Beach, Ramiro had been imprisoned for charges not revealed in the story, but hinted to be numerous and violent. His release is contingent on cooperation with the DEA, on the authorization and supervision of his twin brother, a career DEA agent. Ram does not believe in being careful, playing by the rules, or letting his enemies live very long. During the game, Ram is given the nickname &quot;Gringo Loco&quot; by the enemies he faces. Ram also calls himself &quot;Gringo Loco&quot; on occasion in the game as well.\n\n    * Tomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Cruz: Ram's twin brother, playable for the second mission only. Tommy is a high-ranking DEA agent who has infiltrated the Morales Cartel to investigate a lead on his father's death. His mission is threatened to abort when he suffers major injuries due to a grenade explosion at a gas station, until he recruits his twin brother Ram to take on his undercover persona. Tommy maintains contact via a radio link through which he provides information and advice Ram may or may not take. On the Chili Con Carnage website, Tommy is seen as Ernesto's profile picture. It is unknown if this was accidental or not.\n\n    * Ernesto Cruz: The Cruz boys' father, playable for the first mission only. Ernesto is a deep-cover DEA agent who, after a successful raid in South America, unfortunately fell victim to a corrupt group of D.E.A. who pushed him out of a plane. Ernesto's death in Total Overdose is related to the &quot;Overdose&quot; portion of the game's title.\n\n    * Papa Muerte: A mysterious drug lord who is responsible for the death of Ernesto Cruz and countless others. An underworld figure of legend, his true identity is unknown, and you will spend most of the game hunting him down but will never meet him.\n\n    * Commander Trust : Tommy's boss, who is not too thrilled with Ram being sent to handle things. Commander Trust is most often seen interrogating Tommy Cruz about his brother's conduct and the operation involving him.\n\n    * Marco the Rat : Owner of Marco's Junkyard in Los Toros and Tommy Cruz's primary contact with the Morales Cartel. After Ram bails him out of trouble with the Virgilio he becomes a valuable asset.\n\n    * Cesar Morales: Head of the notorious Morales Cartel, he runs most of the drug traffic in Los Toros, though he faces increasing competition from the Virgilio Cartel. He also owns a meat packing plant, a trucking company, and a shipping business. Not to mention the fact that he's the Los Toros Bullfighting Commissioner.\n\n    * Angel: Cesar Morales's beautiful chauffeur/enforcer, and a cool and capable lieutenant with a mysterious air. Tension and apparent love interest between her and Ram develop throughout the story.\n\n    * Special Agent Johnson: Former partner of Ernesto, a highly trained veteran DEA agent who has put a lot of work into the Papa Muerte case seemingly with little result. Also known for his cowboy hat and John-Wayne-style modus operandi.\n\n    * Special Agent Piersson: Another veteran DEA agent who worked with Ernesto, and a close partner with Johnson.\n\n    * General Montanez: A corrupt high-ranking leader of the Mexican army who has worked with the CIA and DEA but is currently employed by Papa Muerte.\n\n    * Elvez Gonzales: Wealthy auto salesman, playboy and good friend of Cesar Morales. Also heavily traffics in arms and technologies that support Cesar Morales' supremacy in organized crime.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n---------Gangs---------\n    * Morientes gang\n\nThe Morientes gang only appears in a challenge called Morientes Mow Down where the player must take an elevator to the top of a tower and then kill the gang members from top to bottom of the tower.\n\n    * The Virgillos\n\nThe Virgillos are a Mexican drug cartel, led by Joey Virgillo and his cousin (or brother) Rico Virgillo. They mostly live on farms and ranches where they keep their drugs. They also own a gas station outside of Los Toros, El Macho Bar and Los Toros Boatyard. They are number 1 enemies to Morales Cartel. At the beginning player will have to battle against them, but later he will be allied with them.\n\n    * Papa Muerte's Gang\n\nLed by Papa Muerte this is huge organization controlling part of Zona Industrial, meat factory outside of Los Toros (they actually keep drugs in there), Elvez's Car Dealership, Elvez's House, and also a military camp in jungle. They are antagonists on the game and are also on bad terms with another drug cartel, the Virgillo Gang. It comes in these factions:\n\n    * Morales Cartel\n\nControlling major part of drug business in Los Toros, notorious Morales Cartel is led by Cesar Morales and their arch-enemies are Virgillos.\n\n    * Elvez Cartel\n\nLed by Elvez Gonzales, wealthy car salesman, this gang is heavily involved in arms trafficking.\n\n    * Corrupt Military\n\nLed by General Montanez, their military camp is deep in jungle.\n\n    * Corrupt Police\n\nLed by Officer Mendez.\n\n    * Corrupt DEA\n\nLed by Special Agent Johnson, who betrayed DEA and killed Ernesto Cruz.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------Weapons----------\nFist\nYour basic weapon. Always with you, always useful if you're in range, and never costs ammo. Note that your method of using them changes depending on your angle to the enemy. You can punch, kick, elbow smash, groin stomp, head butt, and do all kinds of dirty smackdowns. Even when you have another weapon equipped, if you're close enough to your target you can do unarmed attacks and gain bonuses for them.\n\nMelee Weapons\nIron bar, baseball bat, rake, shovel, machete, etc. Grab these to increase your hand-to-hand skills. These take the place of the fist and have a greater range and higher damage.\n\nHandgun\nThe most common weapon. Ammo is plentiful and guns are accurate. At higher levels of skill, its accuracy makes it as lethal as any higher powered weapon.\n\nHeavy Magnum\nIt holds less ammo than the pistol and is bit rarer, but its shots are more powerful.\n\nSawn-Off Shotgun\nLike the pistol it's quite plentiful. Very powerful but runs out of ammo quick. Short Range.\n\nCombat Shotgun\nPacks more ammo than the Sawn-Off Shotgun, and can't be dual-wield like the sawn-off shotgun.\n\nSubmachine Gun (SMG)\nMP5s, Uzis, Ingrams. These hold lots of ammo and are great for spraying around while shoot dodging. The smaller ones can be dual-wielded once you have enough Weapon Skill.\n\nRifle\nYour basic long range gun, usually found in the hands of enemies. You can get Hunting Rifles or basic Rifles- which can be Dual Wielded with enough Weapon Skill.\n\nAssault Rifle\nAK47s or modern M4s. Long range with rapid fire.\n\nGrenades and Other Explosives\nGrenades, Dynamite, Molotov Cocktails. All useful, all available. Note that the Grenades and Dynamite bounce when you throw them so be careful. You can also shoot them while they're in the air for maximum effect.\n\nGrenade Launcher\nThis gun launches bouncing explosives over a long distance.\n\nRocket Launcher\nHeavy damage, very hard to find. Will blow up most any structure or vehicle in one shot. Be careful you're not nearby when the shell impacts.\n\nGun Turret\nThese can be found in freeroam and some missions on high places overlooking the street.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-----------Loco moves-----------\nThese moves are special attacks you can pick up by scoring large amounts of points and combo kills. Use them wisely to eliminate particularly tough foes (like bosses) and/or groups of enemies. Note that you are invincible for a limited time while executing a Loco Move. The time the loco move lasts is EQUAL to your maximum health when it begins, but the time of the locomove drains during the use of it.\n\nGolden Gun\nYou receive a literally golden gun with four bullets that are automatically lethal to all enemies except bosses. This weapon does NOT give the headshot combo message like the other weapons capable of doing a headshot due to it being an auto-headshot weapon which the lack of the headshot combo message also applies if used from two shots to its four rounds during a &quot;wall-walk&quot; (running jump off the wall; a headshot during the Wall-Walk is either called Fly on the wall or King of the Wall depending if you get the headshot while running on the wall or during the flip off the wall). Ram can be harmed during this loco move.\n\nTornado\nRam spins around firing twin sub-machine guns and takes down all enemies in a 360 degree radius. Sometimes Ram will shout &quot;HuracÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n RamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­rez!!&quot; after accomplishing this move. It is an easy way to get the Uzis in your inventory.\n\nEl Toro\nRam lowers his head like a bull and runs around in an automatic forward motion. Anybody he bumps into dies. It is ineffective if the enemy is in an area out of the reach of Ram during the Loco move (for example an enemy on the higher level that Ram is unable to reach Before, during and after the Loco move is used.).\n\nEl Mariachi\nThis special move gives you two guitar cases with machine guns with infinite ammunition hidden inside. The attack is an obvious ode to the Mariachi Trilogy.\n\nSombrero of Death\nThis move creates a AI sombrero-wearing zombie wielding a grenade launcher who will help you eliminate your foes. The zombie is invincible for the duration of the move, but Ram is not, which makes this loco move one of the three loco moves that leaves Ram vulnerable for attack during use. Ram can also be damaged by the grenades, making this one of the two moves Ram is vulnerable to friendly fire.\n\nExplosive PiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ata\nWhen used the enemy is distracted by the piÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ata (which is either a duck or goat) which can be shot or left to explode on its own. When it explodes, it takes out the enemies that went near it and humorously showers confetti during the aftermath of the explosion.\n\nMad Wrestler/Mysterioso\nThis move summons Numero Cinco, a powerful luchador wielding a random melee weapon. In Chili Con Carnage he is replaced by El Gimpo. Ram is vulnerable to attack during this loco move, and can even be damaged by the mad wrestler's melee attacks.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------Vehicles----------\nVehicles can be boarded from either side door, whether parked or in motion. Commandeering a vehicle that already has a driver moves that driver to the passenger seat as he makes panicked or pleading remarks in Spanish. Many passenger vehicles have a novelty horn which plays La Cucaracha or a few bars of FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼r Elise in beeps. Vehicles can range in size from the semi to motorcycle.\n\nVehicles can be used offensively, either by directly ramming a target, or opening the driver's side door to strike a pedestrian. Leaping from a vehicle in motion turns it into an improvised explosive; it will explode on any front-end contact, even if it has coasted to a near stop. Kills made while leaping from a vehicle are rewarded with significantly high point values, and targeted shots while in mid-air are the highest scoring in the game.\n\nAlthough all cars in game are fictitious, they are based on real cars and unlike other games, they bear over 95% resemblance to their real life counterparts, making them easy to identify and connect with real life counterparts. Here's a list of cars found in the game.\n\n1988 Olds 88, 1992 Nissan Trusu, 1985 Chevrolet silverado, 1986 Chevrolet beauville, 1986 Mercury colony park, 1984 Pontiac Trans Am, 1999 Kenworth rig, 1940 Ford Flatbed, 1980 Ford Rig, 1960 Chevrolet pickup, 1975 Chevrolet El Camino.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------Special vehicles----------\nIn the game, there are several vehicles found throughout the missions. Most of them can be found in free roam around Los Toros.\n\nJoey Virgilio's &quot;Conquistador&quot;\nRed with a black stripe in color and a protruding engine from the bonnet. This vehicle is nicknamed the &quot;DeLoros&quot; by fans due to its slight resemblance to a (heavily modified) DeLorean Motor Car. This car appears early on in the game and is possibly the fastest custom car in the game. Unfortunately, at the end of the mission in which it appears, the player must give it up. Made more unfortunate since the player had to keep the car in good condition as an element of this particular mission. However, this car can be found in free roam on the curve of the small stretch of road leading to Angel's Apartment. This car is considered excellent for making the big jumps to get any high bonuses.\n\nCaesar Morales' Orange Dirtbike\nAfter killing the Morales character and escaping from his exploding bull-ring on the said dirtbike, it will be parked outside the bull-ring ready for the player to take when they want. Like most cars in the game it will always spawn there, even if the player is already driving it.\n\nAngel's Purple And Flame Pickup\nThis car is available to drive in free roam as well. Although, it's a little bit more complex to get this vehicle. To find it, the player must first, go to end of the tunnel near Angel's flat where there are cars overlooking the cliff, one of these cars will be a rusty pickup like Angel's. Steal this car and drive to, then through, the magic of sharp eyes and spawning you should see Angel's pickup parked somewhere (unfortunately without the Gun Turret on the back) for you to take whenever you want. Like most cars this will spawn in many places even when you're driving it. Ram has possession of the car in the intro of the game as well in Chili Con Carnage, causing speculation if Ram or Angel own the car or share it.\n\nMarco's Tow Truck\nAfter being used in a mission Marco's tow truck is always available at his junkyard.\n\nPolice Cars\nAfter completing the game, it is possible for the player to get back to the DEA just by traveling along the side of a hill near the toll-gates while keeping close to an invisible barrier then the player will be able to find a Police Car to drive. In the PC version, there are also drivable Police Cars in El Centro, parked along the beach expressway from the gas station. Also sometimes at the cliff near angel's apartment where the two cars are parked, the van sometimes is a police van, but other times it's just a rusted beat up one.\n\nDEA and Military SUVs\nThese may be found in in later missions, and in free roam in random locations after certain story missions. These are most often locked, but it's possible to shoot the driver out of a cruising DEA or Military vehicle, and then take possession of the vehicle and drive around with the broken windows. These can take more impacts and gunfire than many other vehicles in the game, but like any other vehicles will explode on contact when Ram leaps from it while it's in motion.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon't forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b585344925bf3e9721cb7e6559fb0ebaaa814a3e","amp;dn":"Total+Overdose+%28Full+Rip%29+%28Nicely+Compressed%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b585344925bf3e9721cb7e6559fb0ebaaa814a3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,133,52,73,37,191,62,151,33,203,126,101,89,251,14,186,170,129,74,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
