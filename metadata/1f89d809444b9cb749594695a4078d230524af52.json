But, all too often, this transition is being made with reckless disregard for security. If Ajax applications arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t designed and coded properly, they can be susceptible to far more dangerous security vulnerabilities than conventional Web or desktop software. Ajax developers desperately need guidance on securing their applications: knowledge thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been virtually impossible to find, until now.\nAjax Security systematically debunks todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most dangerous myths about Ajax security, illustrating key points with detailed case studies of actual exploited Ajax vulnerabilities, ranging from MySpaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Samy worm to MacWorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s conference code validator. Even more important, it delivers specific, up-to-the-minute recommendations for securing Ajax applications in each major Web programming language and environment, including .NET, Java, PHP, and even Ruby on Rails. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn how to:\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Mitigate unique risks associated with Ajax, including overly granular Web services, application control flow tampering, and manipulation of program logic\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Write new Ajax code more safelyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and identify and fix flaws in existing code\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Prevent emerging Ajax-specific attacks, including JavaScript hijacking and persistent storage theft\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Avoid attacks based on XSS and SQL InjectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including a dangerous SQL Injection variant that can extract an entire backend database with just two requests\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Leverage security built into Ajax frameworks like Prototype, Dojo, and ASP.NET AJAX ExtensionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and recognize what you still must implement on your own\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Create more secure ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmashupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ applications\n\nAjax Security will be an indispensable resource for developers coding or maintaining Ajax applications; architects and development managers planning or designing new Ajax software, and all software security professionals, from QA specialists to penetration testers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f89d809444b9cb749594695a4078d230524af52","amp;dn":"Ajacurity+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f89d809444b9cb749594695a4078d230524af52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,137,216,9,68,75,156,183,73,89,70,149,164,7,141,35,5,36,175,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
