Smedberg\n\nUnderstanding the Latin Prayers of the Rosary teaches you how to pronounce and understand the Latin of the most basic Catholic prayers: the Sign of the Cross, the Apostles' Creed, the Our Father, the Hail Mary, the Glory Be, the Fatima Prayer, the Hail Holy Queen and the concluding prayers of the Rosary. All the Joyful, Luminous, Sorrowful, and Glorious Mysteries are included in Latin, and a Latin Bible verse is included for each Mystery. The book gives you the exact meaning of each Latin word of the prayers, the Mysteries, and the Bible verses, and gives you an English derivative for each word to help you remember the meanings.\n\nThe audio CD accompanying the book pronounces the words of each prayer clearly, and the Pater Noster, Ave Maria, and Salve Regina are also sung with traditional chant melodies. When you have learned to pronounce the words of the prayers, you can pray the Rosary along with the CD. Start with Track 9 which prays all the introductory prayers together. Then choose the track which announces the Mystery and its Bible verse, and skip back to Track 10 for a complete decade of the Rosary. After alternating the Mysteries and deacdes, finish the Rosary with the concluding prayers on Track 8.\n\nA special section of the book and a track of the audio CD present the rules of Latin pronunciation, so you can learn to pronounce any Latin word.\n\nUnderstanding the Latin Prayers of the Rosary is well suited for the use of Catholic school teachers, CCD and Religious Education teachers, parents, and individuals to learn the most basic Catholic prayers in Latin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:556ac4e0811eb08a803095f10156d571cdc7b5fe","amp;dn":"Understanding+The+Latin+Prayers+Of+The+Rosary+reseed.nrg.nrg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"556ac4e0811eb08a803095f10156d571cdc7b5fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,106,196,224,129,30,176,138,128,48,149,241,1,86,213,113,205,199,181,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
