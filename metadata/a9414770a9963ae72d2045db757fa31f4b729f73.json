When three people are violently  \n                    murdered and a fourth left for dead in a  \n                    central London shop, DS Ronnie Brooks and DS  \n                    Matt Devlin are up against the clock as they  \n                    try to find the culprit, who they fear could  \n                    strike again at any time. Their search is  \n                    helped by information about the unusual murder  \n                    weapon - a bayonet.
