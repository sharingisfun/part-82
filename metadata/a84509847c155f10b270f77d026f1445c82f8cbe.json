Jack Stiles is an American secret agent sent there by President Jefferson. While there, he meets his British contact and love interest, English spy Emilia Rothschild. Together, the two work to stop Napoleon  and various other threats to the United States. To the public, Jack is seen as Emilia's servant (she sometimes serves as his), but when the need arises, he transforms into a masked hero: the Daring Dragoon.The show contained many on-going gags, such as deliberate historical inaccuracies (such as Canada being a French territory rather than part of the British Empire), Jack being responsible for many important historical events but not receiving credit, Emilia inventing a miraculous invention in an obvious deus ex machina, and Jack and Emilia's ongoing romantic tension.\n\n\nCast\n\n    * Bruce Campbell - Jack Stiles\n    * Angela Dotchin - Emilia Rothschild\n    * Stuart Devenie - Governor Croque\n    * Stephen Papps - Captain Brogard\n    * Verne Troyer - Napoleon Bonaparte (recurring guest - 4 episodes)\n\n\nEpisodes\n\nSeason 1\nEpisode Number \tEpisode title \tOriginal air date\n1-1 \t&quot;Return of the Dragoon-&quot; \t22 January 2000 (2000-01-22)\n1-2 \t&quot;Sex and the Single Spy&quot; \t29 January 2000 (2000-01-29)\n1-3 \t&quot;The Floundering Father&quot; \t5 February 2000 (2000-02-05)\n1-4 \t&quot;Once You Go Jack...&quot; \t12 February 2000 (2000-02-12)\n1-5 \t&quot;The People's Dragoon&quot; \t19 February 2000 (2000-02-19)\n1-6 \t&quot;Raging Bully&quot; \t26 February 2000 (2000-02-26)\n1-7 \t&quot;Daddy Dearest&quot; \t4 March 2000 (2000-03-04)\n1-8 \t&quot;One Wedding and an Execution&quot; \t11 March 2000 (2000-03-11)\n1-9 \t&quot;Croque for a Day&quot; \t15 April 2000 (2000-04-15)\n1-10 \t&quot;Dead Woman Walking&quot; \t22 April 2000 (2000-04-22)\n1-11 \t&quot;Love Potion No. 10&quot; \t29 April 2000 (2000-04-29)\n1-12 \t&quot;Up the Creek&quot; \t6 May 2000 (2000-05-06)\n1-13 \t&quot;X Marquis the Spot&quot; \t13 May 2000 (2000-05-13)\n1-14 \t&quot;It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Opera&quot; \t20 May 2000 (2000-05-20)\n\nSeason 2\nEpisode Number \tEpisode title \tOriginal air date\n2-1 \t&quot;A Horse of a Different Color&quot; \t7 October 2000 (2000-10-07)\n2-2 \t&quot;Shark Bait&quot; \t14 October 2000 (2000-10-14)\n2-3 \t&quot;Monkey Business&quot; \t28 October 2000 (2000-10-28)\n2-4 \t&quot;The Morning After&quot; \t4 November 2000 (2000-11-04)\n2-5 \t&quot;Croquey in the Pokey&quot; \t11 November 2000 (2000-11-11)\n2-6 \t&quot;One, Two, Three, Give Me Lady Liberty&quot; \t18 November 2000 (2000-11-18)\n2-7 \t&quot;Hamnesia&quot; \t25 November 2000 (2000-11-25)\n2-8 \t&quot;Seventy Brides for One Brother&quot; \t2 December 2000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a84509847c155f10b270f77d026f1445c82f8cbe","amp;dn":"Jack+of+All+Trades","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a84509847c155f10b270f77d026f1445c82f8cbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,69,9,132,124,21,95,16,178,112,247,125,2,111,20,69,200,47,140,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
