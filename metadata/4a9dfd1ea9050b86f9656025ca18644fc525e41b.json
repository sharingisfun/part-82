Muslims, Jews and Christians of many kinds pass before his jaundiced eye. Maher goes to a Creationist Museum in Kentucky, which shows that dinosaurs and people lived at the same time 5000 years ago. He talks to truckers at a Truckers\\' Chapel. (Sign outside: \\&quot;Jesus love you.\\&quot;) He goes to a theme park called Holy Land in Florida. He speaks to a rabbi in league with Holocaust deniers. He talks to a Muslim musician who preaches hatred of Jews. Maher finds the unlikeliest of believers and, in a certain Vatican priest, he even finds an unlikely skeptic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 ****EOD****\n\n                         Even Firefighters need Heroes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a9dfd1ea9050b86f9656025ca18644fc525e41b","amp;dn":"Religulous++++EoD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a9dfd1ea9050b86f9656025ca18644fc525e41b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,157,253,30,169,5,11,134,249,101,96,37,202,24,100,79,197,37,228,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
