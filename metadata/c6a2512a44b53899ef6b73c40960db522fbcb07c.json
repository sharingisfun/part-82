A \nWork Inspired by Hashemsfilms and of Course the Words of the Noble Qoran, The \nHoly Bible, and The Torah, The Arrivals is a Joint Production by truthseekers \nNoreagaaa, Mani Shah and Achernahr.\n\nOne God, One Original Msg. and that is the ultimate truth. a truth that does not \nbenefit those in power.\n\nWe expect to be attacked with discrediting campaigns from various parties who \nare not in favor of The Arrivals or the Divine Book gaining such a wide \naudience. We believe that the genuine viewers understood what our films \nrepresented, &amp; will be able to see through the lies, propaganda, &amp; personal \nattacks, to focus on the positive and uniting msg we worked hard to deliver. \nIf I have shed any light, or exposed any meaningful truth that has helped \nimprove this world in any way, then all the credit is due to Allah(God) the \nabsolute Creator, and only the mistakes have been mine.\n\nThe Arrivals Reloaded TV Version\n\nThe WUP has teamed up with the ARY Digital Network and Mani Shah media \nentertainment to bring you the phenomenal TV Version of The Arrivals. The \nArrivals Reloaded will feature new information, interviews, original scores, \nanimation, and professional production while sticking to the spirit of the \nonline version you've all seen. \n\nType.................: Movie\nMore Info............: http://www.wakeupproject.com\nBurn Tested..........: Yes\n\nVideo Format.........: DVD 5\nVideo Bitrate........: 192\nResolution...........: 720 x 576\nSource...............: DVD 16x9\nOriginal Format......: PAL\nGenre................: Documentary\nIMDb Rating..........: 10+\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               Post Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPosted by............: Mani Shah (http://www.manishah.co.nr)\nPosted on............: 7/28/2010\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[img]http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/2568/arrivalsreloaded.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://img265.imageshack.us/img265/8206/screenshotsxu.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6a2512a44b53899ef6b73c40960db522fbcb07c","amp;dn":"The+Arrivals+Reloaded+by+Mani+Shah+and+ARY+Digital","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6a2512a44b53899ef6b73c40960db522fbcb07c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,162,81,42,68,181,56,153,239,107,115,196,9,96,219,82,47,188,176,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
