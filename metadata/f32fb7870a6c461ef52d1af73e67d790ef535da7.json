Undoubtedly, though, he is best known as the quintessential American dissident.\n\nChomskyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s criticism of U.S. foreign policy began with the Vietnam War and continued over the span of the next 40 years (and roughly as many books). NOAM CHOMSKY ON THE WORLD delves into the mind of the man himself through a series of candid interviews, lectures, and classroom discussions in which he traces the entire arc of 20th century American politics, from 1920s public policy to 9/11. Even more importantly, the professor emeritus sketches out a history of resistance and struggle that is fundamental to his political thought and, he claims, to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcivilizingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of America. Disarmingly straightforward, tremendously informed, and profoundly insightful, Chomsky has the rare ability to illuminate larger patterns and systems, bringing viewers to a far deeper understanding of history, power, and the uniquely American privilege of protest.\n\nThoroughly absorbing and edifying, NOAM CHOMSKY ON THE WORLD profiles the luminous thinking of a man who has spent his life striving to educate, to empower, and ultimately, to liberate.\n\nDVD FEATURES\nComplete Bonus Lecture: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIs there intelligent life on Earth?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f32fb7870a6c461ef52d1af73e67d790ef535da7","amp;dn":"Noam+Chomsky+On+The+World%3A+The+Chomsky+Sessions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f32fb7870a6c461ef52d1af73e67d790ef535da7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,47,183,135,10,108,70,30,245,45,26,247,62,103,215,144,239,83,93,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
