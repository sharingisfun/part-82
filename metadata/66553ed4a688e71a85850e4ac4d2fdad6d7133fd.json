(Hungary) November 2010.\n\n\nCKM is a family of cultural semi-erotic monthly magazines for men, focused mainly on entertainment and factography. It encompasses editions in Poland and Hungary. The written tone is outspoken, provocative, at the same time finding humour and dealing with the most serious issues. The Polish edition and Hungarian edition was launched in 1998. There is also a CKM - Serbian edition, launched in September 2003.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66553ed4a688e71a85850e4ac4d2fdad6d7133fd","amp;dn":"CKM+Magazine.+%28Hungary%29+November+2010.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66553ed4a688e71a85850e4ac4d2fdad6d7133fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,85,62,212,166,136,231,26,133,133,14,74,196,210,253,173,109,113,51,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
