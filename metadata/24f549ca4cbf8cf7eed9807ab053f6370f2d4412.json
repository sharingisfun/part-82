The letter    \n    suggests that Joseph Forsyth Johnson was married to two   \n    women at the same time and that he died at sea. Bruce      \n    is determined to investigate these claims and discover    \n    the truth for himself.                                   \n                                                              \n    Bruce starts by visiting his cousin, Alan Johnson, who     \n    gives him a cache of family photographs and the diary     \n    of his great Aunt Christina, which he takes with him.    \n    Alan also gives him Joseph's business card - a vital      \n    aid for Bruce in tracking Joseph and his family's steps    \n    in the late 19th century.                                 \n                                                             \n    Bruce follows the business card to Bond Street, London,   \n    where Joseph opened a landscape gardening shop. Knowing    \n    that Joseph worked in America at some point, Bruce        \n    tracks down the passenger lists for Joseph's journey     \n    and is in for a shock. He heads off to New York on        \n    Joseph's trail, which then takes him to the American       \n    South.                                                    \n                                                             \n    Bruce's quest to uncover his great grandfather's secret   \n    history ends back in New York where he finally             \n    discovers Joseph's fate. Joseph was a man who was both    \n    an extraordinary pioneer in his field; but also a man    \n    who bucked the social mores of the day and paid dearly    \n    for it, leaving a trail of confusion and unhappiness in    \n    his wake.                                                 \n                                                                \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n    The BBC are rewriting episode/season history, last year    \n    we released s7, the bbc have now decided that those eps   \n    were the 2nd part of season 6, what they will be listed  \n    as next year we honestly dont know, it's rather hard to   \n    make sense of their listings considering it was labelled   \n    by them as s7 at the time, imdb still lists the           \n    new season as s8, but that could change tonight          \n    /tomorrow/next week.                                      \n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0429466/episodes#season-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0429466/episodes#season-8&lt;/a&gt;      \n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1692823/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1692823/&lt;/a&gt;                      \n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00t6gbb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00t6gbb&lt;/a&gt;                 \n                                                              \n    We leave it up to folks to decide whether they want to     \n    label as s7 or s8, as quite frankly it gives us a head    \n    -ache trying to follow bbc labelling decisions sometimes.\n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24f549ca4cbf8cf7eed9807ab053f6370f2d4412","amp;dn":"Who.Do.You.Think.You.Are.UK.Bruce.Forsyth.READ.NFO.720p.HDTV.x26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24f549ca4cbf8cf7eed9807ab053f6370f2d4412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,245,73,202,76,191,140,247,238,217,128,122,176,83,246,55,15,45,68,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
