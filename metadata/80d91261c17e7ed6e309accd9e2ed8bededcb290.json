As of version 2.3.0.0, ImgBurn can create image files from unencrypted CDs/DVDs. It cannot, however, remove CSS encryption or any other copy protection. It is possible to use third-party software such as DVD43, an intermediate driver that operates between the hardware and software, for such purpose.\n\nit says portable because you can put it on an external hdd and open without having to install it.\n\nits a clean file. scanned with avast anti virus ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80d91261c17e7ed6e309accd9e2ed8bededcb290","amp;dn":"Imgburn+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80d91261c17e7ed6e309accd9e2ed8bededcb290","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,217,18,97,193,126,126,214,227,9,172,205,158,46,216,190,222,220,178,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
