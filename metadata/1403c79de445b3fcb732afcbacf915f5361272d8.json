The journal has gained a worldwide reputation, demonstrated by its high ranking in the ISI Science Citation Index, as a forum for general and specialised communication between biophysicists working in different areas. The majority of reviews published are invited from authors who have made significant contributions to the field, who give critical, readable and sometimes controversial accounts of recent progress and problems in their speciality. Thematic issues are occasionally published.\n\n- journals.cambridge.org\n\n\nIssue 01:\npp. 1 - 56: Nucleoside triphosphate-binding proteins--different scaffolds to achieve phosphoryl transfer\npp. 57 - 98: NMR studies of protein-nucleic acid complexes--structures, solvation, dynamics and coupled protein folding\n\nIssue 02:\npp. 99 - 187: Intermediate filaments--molecular architecture, assembly, dynamics and polymorphism\npp. 189 - 205: Channel-forming colicins--translocation (and other deviant behaviour) associated with colicin Ia channel gating\n\nIssue 03:\npp. 211 - 240: NMR-based screening in drug discovery\npp. 241 - 284: Biophysical and biochemical investigations of RNA catalysis in the hammerhead ribozyme\n\nIssue 04:\npp. 285 - 307: Recent advances in the understanding of membrane protein assembly and structure\npp. 309 - 370: Prion propagation and molecular chaperones","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1403c79de445b3fcb732afcbacf915f5361272d8","amp;dn":"Quarterly+Review+of+Biophysics%2C+Volume+32","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1403c79de445b3fcb732afcbacf915f5361272d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,3,199,157,228,69,179,252,183,50,175,203,172,249,21,245,54,18,114,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
