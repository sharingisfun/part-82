Introducing\nSushant Singh\nAsif Basra\n\nSynopsis\n\nKnock Out is a fast-paced thriller that happens in real time. In just two hours- 11am to 1pm - an enigmatic vigilante pulls off an incredible, mind-blowing coup and a new chapter of Indian history is written.\n\nSanjay Dutt plays a new age lone ranger who has the latest weapons and gadgets at his fingertips, and is a man who trusts and depends on no one. Working alone, he effortlessly uses his wit, his skills at hand-to-hand combat, and his love for stealth technology, to manipulate and trap his elusive target.\n\nThe target, played by Irrfan, is a street-smart investment banker who has made his way to the upper echelons of power. A man who unwittingly holds the key to India's destiny, Irrfan is a man consumed by his own obsessions, an extremely clever and unstoppable foe. Through a brilliant play of truth and pretense, Sanjay strips Irrfan of his arrogance and attitude, opens his heart and confounds his brain, locking him in a tangle beyond redemption... a tangle which can only be unraveled one way... leading to the biggest 'counter-heist' in the history of this nation.\n\nVideo: MPEG1 Video 352x288 (4:3) 25.00fps 1150Kbps [Video]\nAudio: MPEG Audio 48000Hz stereo 64Kbps [Audio]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a81e1ee1ef728875c1c6ac557ad3d9ca6e0459e","amp;dn":"Knock+Out+2010+Camrip.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a81e1ee1ef728875c1c6ac557ad3d9ca6e0459e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,129,225,238,30,247,40,135,92,28,106,197,87,173,61,156,166,224,69,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
