In this film we discover how the deadliest avalanche in history killed 18,000 people in just a few minutes; how Hannibal's army was devastated by avalanches as he crossed the Alps to fight Rome; why an avalanche was key to one of the greatest aviation mysteries of all time; and how global warming may increase the rate of ice avalanches in the future.\n\nFile Size ------- 348mb\nLength ---------- 45:41\nResolution ------ 720x432\nContainer ------- avi\nVideo Codec ----- h264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 24\n\nTracked and seeded by thehashden.com\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe6618984ecb58a63fd36b734fb171cc7fd8f078","amp;dn":"National+Geographic%3A+Avalanches","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe6618984ecb58a63fd36b734fb171cc7fd8f078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,102,24,152,78,203,88,166,63,211,107,115,79,177,113,204,127,216,240,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
