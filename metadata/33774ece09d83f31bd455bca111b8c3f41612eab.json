I know some small amounts are still arriving and I can only hope that he will eventually get enough to get a new PC and get back to doing what he does better than anyone else.\n\nA genius is gone, long live 20-40.\n\nBefore he went he very kindly shared his tool-set to make the brilliant encodes, high quality &amp; small file size.\n\nI would never attempt to fill his shoes, I don't have an iota of his skills, but I will try to keep his memory alive (hopefully until he returns) to remind you of what you are missing.\n\nI will be UP'ing the odd show as and when I can using his tools. My PC is not powerful enough to encode many and so the choice will be limited.\n\nBelow is my 'planned' schedule for today. I'll add to this as soon as more shows are encoded. So please check back on 20-40 and my homepage for updates.\n\nSchedule for tomorrow (not necessarily in this order)\nWarehouse 13\nRescue Me\nMemphis Beat\nCovert Affairs\nCraig Ferguson 10th August\n\n\nI'll UP the encodes as soon as my PC has encoded them but it will take time, some will be quicker than others depending on source and size.\n\nSo don't bitch about the time it takes and NO requests. \n\nYou all had your chance with 20-40 and could have helped out and I'm sure he would've been very grateful.\n\nJon\n\nP.S. If you want to help get 20-40 back then please help and donate some cash. Contact me and I'll give you his contact details. THIS IS NOT A SCAM as some 'people' have said, among other things, it is an honest plea for help.\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0f456061503b697a614f67607b626e6663216c6062&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33774ece09d83f31bd455bca111b8c3f41612eab","amp;dn":"Craig.Ferguson.2010.08.09.Lindsay.Sloane.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33774ece09d83f31bd455bca111b8c3f41612eab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,119,78,206,9,216,63,49,189,69,91,202,17,27,140,63,65,97,46,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
