Energetic, skinny, Cape Bretonian marsupials with grey furry ears and coats; feeds on burgers, KD, toast and PB and J. Songs: an honest approach to the trials and tribulations of life, taking into consideration small town values, coming of age, intriguing people encountered, friendship, hope and the various conflicts that arise from a jobless island and its steady outflow of people.\n\nAlthough minimalist in terms of numbers, their sound is anything but that. Self described as \\&quot;The most noise two Cape Bretoners can make\\&quot;, that noise is a cascade or passion, urgency and belief in their songs.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1525b4eff8b593b8e93af15b93140bfe5e9bb694","amp;dn":"The+Town+Heroes+-+Birds+and+Fear+256kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1525b4eff8b593b8e93af15b93140bfe5e9bb694","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,37,180,239,248,181,147,184,233,58,241,91,147,20,11,254,94,155,182,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
