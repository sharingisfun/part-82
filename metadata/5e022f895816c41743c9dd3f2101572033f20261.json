Cool J - Mama Said Knock You Out [promo].VOB\n\n\n\nHQ promo music video. &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot; is a hit single by LL Cool J from his album of the same name. The song's famous beginning is &quot;Don't call it a comeback / I've been here for years.&quot; Before &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot; was released, many people felt that LL Cool J's career was waning; hisgrandmother, who still believed in his talent, told him to &quot;knock out&quot; all the critics. \n\nThis music video features LL Cool J in a boxing ring, rapping into a microphone similar to the one an announcer would use in a boxing match. Frequently we see shots of him working out and scenes of a boxer being punched out. At the end of the video, his grandmother says &quot;Todd! Todd! Get upstairs and take out that garbage&quot;. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mama_Said_Knock_You_Out_(song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mama_Said_Knock_You_Out_(song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oAbBPaaDJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oAbBPaaDJ&lt;/a&gt; \n \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 4707kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Media Length: 00:04:57\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
