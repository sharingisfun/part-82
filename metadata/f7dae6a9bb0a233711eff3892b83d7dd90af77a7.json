As usual in this musical genre, a remix means that the songs were completely re-written and have musically little in common with the original ones. \n\nThe style ranges from Dark Electro and Aggrotech to just Techno or Rave. Very dancefloor-worthy, merges together elements of commercial techno-trance and alternative dark electronic scene.\n\nThose following aggressive but melodic and danceable music from the borderland of electro-industrial and commercial, party-oriented techno and trance will be more than pleased with this release.\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis release sounds similiar to: \nAmduscia, Blutengel, Combichrist, Covenant,  Diary of Dreams, Feindflug, Front Line Assembly, Funker Vogt, God Module, Grendel, Hocico, Icon of Coil, In Strict Confidence, Noisuf-X, Psyclon Nine, Sam, Soman, Suicide Commando, Tactical Sekt, VNV Nation, Wolfsheim, Wumpscut, x-Rx.\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7dae6a9bb0a233711eff3892b83d7dd90af77a7","amp;dn":"Bodycall-Mechanically+Recovered+Meat-dark+electro+aggrotech+indu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7dae6a9bb0a233711eff3892b83d7dd90af77a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,218,230,169,187,10,35,55,17,239,243,137,43,131,215,221,144,175,119,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
