Cal, who'll be opening the safe, asks for a gun.\n\nThirty-six hours earlier, Cal is in his office, telling a woman that writing a book isn't easy. (Meanwhile, Eli Loker is describing Cal as a selfish, but brilliant, dangerous, narcissistic bully, adding that he doesn't know why he's worked for him for so long.) The woman replies that Cal's had two years to write his book, and if the publisher doesn't get it by the end of the quarter, they'll sue him for fraud.\n\nDr. Gillian Foster watches the woman leave and warns Cal not to put the Lightman Group's finances at risk. Cal heads for his bank - and accosts a man he believes is planning to rob it. Cal follows the man to a coffee shop and asks to be part of the robbery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 ****EOD****\n\n                         Even Firefighters need Heroes\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7090f314ec3fa8e6683238a7eb726d6154f275c5","amp;dn":"Lie+to+Me+S03E01+In+The+Red+++EoD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7090f314ec3fa8e6683238a7eb726d6154f275c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,144,243,20,236,63,168,230,104,50,56,167,235,114,109,97,84,242,117,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
