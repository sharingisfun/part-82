Convinced by his agent that he's been granted a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, talented British screenwriter &quot;The Ghost&quot; (Ewan McGregor) agrees to aid British prime minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) in completing his memoirs after the leader's former aid dies under mysterious circumstances. Almost immediately after The Ghost arrives at a remote mansion in the U.S. to begin working with the prime minister, Lang is accused of committing a war crime by a former British cabinet minister. Amidst a deluge of protestors and reporters, The Ghost delves into the unfinished manuscript and comes to the terrifying conclusion that his predecessor died because he discovered a link between Prime Minister Lang and the CIA. The more information The Ghost uncovers, the more convinced he becomes that his life could be in danger as well. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : The Ghost Writer.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format profile : OpenDML\n      File size : 2.06 GiB\n      Duration : 2h 8mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 291 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.1 (build 2366/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2366/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 2h 8mn\n      Bit rate : 1 830 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 304 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 2.35:1\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.349\n      Stream size : 1.64 GiB (80%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 2h 8mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 448 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 6 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 412 MiB (20%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139328/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139328/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nBD Rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70d56fbf9dfca13f71f06e2b10e3b29fb8471a5a","amp;dn":"Roman+Polanski+-+The+Ghost+Writer+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70d56fbf9dfca13f71f06e2b10e3b29fb8471a5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,213,111,191,157,252,161,63,113,240,110,43,16,227,178,159,184,71,26,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
