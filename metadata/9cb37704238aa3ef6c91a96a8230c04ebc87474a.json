He has produced for many other artists over the years, his homemade beatz and mixing and catchy hooks and lyrical verses have &quot;Wowed&quot; other artists and executives in the studio. Lyrically creative which helps his beatz jump off the stages! Started off in Toronto towards our very own E-town and now has created a buzz in the Vancouver hip hop scene. The future is bright for Bmoney. This is the year I believe he really has found his studio perfection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cb37704238aa3ef6c91a96a8230c04ebc87474a","amp;dn":"BMoney+Grenier+-+%5C%22Fake+Recordz%5C%22+%28Google+Me%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cb37704238aa3ef6c91a96a8230c04ebc87474a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,179,119,4,35,138,163,239,108,145,169,106,130,48,192,78,188,135,71,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
