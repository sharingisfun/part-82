So here it is: LiebeErika. Friendly and polite, rather thin, extra narrow, and of courseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ carefully hand-crafted.\n\nLiebeErikaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s casual and warm style is perfectly suited for invitations and personal correspondence. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even in the name: German phrase, Liebe ErikaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ translates to, Dear Erika, the beginning of a personal letter. But LiebeErika is not limited to English or to the German character set. It supports many other languages, too! MoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nLiebeErika comes with a stunning variety of ligatures and alternative forms available through OpenType features. (Please make sure your software supports OpenType if you wish to use the advanced features.) The font contains over 500 glyphs, so itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s actually two or three fonts in one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45e626c7fd3652881bcc72091f7e6c9da83280e6","amp;dn":"LiebeFonts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45e626c7fd3652881bcc72091f7e6c9da83280e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,230,38,199,253,54,82,136,27,204,114,9,31,126,108,157,168,50,128,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
