Ian Taylor rides into the Den with his mobile video advertising hoarding on a bike. He wants to expand his Wakefield-based business into the rest of the country, but will the Dragons see nationwide potential in his idea? One of the Den\\'s youngest entrepreneurs, 20-year-old Jessica Ratcliffe, thinks she has found a way into the lucrative computer gaming market with her online marketplace for selling and swapping used games. Now she wants to persuade a Dragon that they need a piece of the action. Plus another young, but very experienced entrepreneur has an accessory that solves a problem all parents of newborns will relate to - how and where to change your baby\\'s nappy in a public environment. But will the multimillionaires recognise the issue, and more importantly, will they spot a money-making opportunity? Also, there is a round-up of the highlights from the series.\n\n\nGeneral           : Dragons Den s08e10\nFormat            : Matroska at 3,590 Kbps\nLength            : 1 GiB for 58mn 57s\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 3,135 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 25 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 384 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d83365e27eca12f6d16ba82d36e80a16cad81ae0","amp;dn":"Dragons%5C%27+Den+S08E010.720p.HDTV.x264-BLACKCOMB.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d83365e27eca12f6d16ba82d36e80a16cad81ae0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,51,101,226,126,202,18,246,209,107,168,45,54,232,10,22,202,216,26,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
