After \ntrying to pawn the pre-freshman off on his housemate (Jon Favreau), Droz sets off on his normal \ndaily activities including disrupting a political protest by throwing meat at a group of vegan protesters. \nThe President of the University then receives a number of complaints, and with the help of her lackey \n(superbly portrayed by David Spade), she may finally have the power to kick Droz's house off campus. \nBut the Pit throws an all-campus rager where George Clinton and the Parliament Funkadelic performs, \nand everything might turn out alright if the various political groups can forget their protests for \none night and just have fun together.\n\n\n--Video--\nFile Type: AVI\nDuration: 1:20:34\nFile Size: 1.59 GB (1,711,026,176 bytes)\nResolution: 720x480\nFPS: 23Frames/second\nData Rate: 345kbps\nCodec: DivX\n\n--Audio--\nBit Rate: 320kbps \nAudio Format: MPEG Layer-3(MP3)\n\n\n--Credited Cast and Crew--\nActor/Actress:  ...
