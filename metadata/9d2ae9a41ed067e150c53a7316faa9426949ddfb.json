But this was a hard damn sync! So their maybe still some spots where go oos but it will come back.\n\nThanks to our good guy in PrisM l0ck for his hard work on syncing the monster.\n\ncredit PrisM &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, extremezone, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic, FASAMOO, W1CK3D1NT3Z, GRIND3R &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img38/3360/o06rew.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img38/3360/o06rew.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img809/4281/207umb6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img809/4281/207umb6.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img822/7163/14914jk.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img822/7163/14914jk.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img340/3627/11awl6e.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img340/3627/11awl6e.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img830.imageshack.us/img830/8152/2dwc3du.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img830.imageshack.us/img830/8152/2dwc3du.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img717/7503/34pkyea.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img717/7503/34pkyea.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDON'T THANK ME...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d2ae9a41ed067e150c53a7316faa9426949ddfb","amp;dn":"Splice.R5.CAM.AUDIO.READNFO.XviD-PrisM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d2ae9a41ed067e150c53a7316faa9426949ddfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,42,233,164,30,208,103,225,80,197,58,115,22,250,169,66,105,73,221,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
