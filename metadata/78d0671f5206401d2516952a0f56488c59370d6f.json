Young inmate Clarence Carnes masterminds a grand escape involving several inmates who have nothing to lose, serving life sentences. (Taken from the IMDb) \n\n\tHere's one I can't find anywhere for downloading. I recorded the original to VHS in the early '80s. This is a fairly good, VHS quality copy, and personally, I think it's quite watchable. I actually met Clarence Carnes once! Hope you can enjoy this one as much as I do. ;-) \n\nPart 1\n\nDuration: 1:36:15\nData Size: 897.94 MB\nBit Rate: 1.30 Mbps\n\nVideo Tracks:\nH.264, 640 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ 480, 29.97 fps, 1.05 Mbps\n\nAudio Tracks:\nMPEG-4 Audio stereo, 48 kHz, 256 kbps\n\nStream Files:\nAlcatraz-The Whole Shocking Story-Part 1 (1980 TVrip H264 AAC).mp4 (897.94 MB)\n\nPart 2\n\nDuration: 1:35:31\nData Size: 894.14 MB\nBit Rate: 1.31 Mbps\n\nVideo Tracks:\nH.264, 640 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ 480, 29.97 fps, 1.05 Mbps\n\nAudio Tracks:\nMPEG-4 Audio stereo, 48 kHz, 256 kbps\n\nStream Files:\nAlcatraz-The Whole Shocking Story-Part 2 (1980 TVrip H264 AAC).mp4 (894.14 MB)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78d0671f5206401d2516952a0f56488c59370d6f","amp;dn":"Alcatraz-The_Whole_Shocking_Story_%281980_TVrip_H264_AAC_NTSC_29.9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78d0671f5206401d2516952a0f56488c59370d6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,208,103,31,82,6,64,29,37,22,149,42,15,86,72,140,89,55,13,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
