But there is a particular place which is doing relatively well and people are spurred to put their money in that country. That is Norway. The rise of precious metals and the reasons behind it is discussed. More and more people are turning into buying gold. The rise in the price of food and agri-products is also discussed.\n\n\n\nThis is extracted audio from the Press TV video.\n\nFor this torrent I have also included the video, joined in one file.  If you don't want to download this file, simply deselect it in your bit torrent client when you are initiating the download.\n\n\nYou can watch the video at these links:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-klJ5nNyjVI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-klJ5nNyjVI&lt;/a&gt; part 1 of 3\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vT4jX8QIkE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vT4jX8QIkE&lt;/a&gt; part 2 of 3\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgbU7qcoiJs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgbU7qcoiJs&lt;/a&gt; part 3 of 3\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
