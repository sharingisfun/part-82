The first section deals with the butterfly itself\n(types, behaviors, habitats, etc.), and the second part provides information on\nhow to photograph these creatures. The main difference between this book\nand the previous book is that digital photography is so much easier than film\nphotography. Many readers will be able to start taking great photographs after\nreading just a few chapters in this book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25a0c837371592520a26b3c9a01635826b2e3111","amp;dn":"Butterfly+Photographers+Handbook.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25a0c837371592520a26b3c9a01635826b2e3111","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,160,200,55,55,21,146,82,10,38,179,201,160,22,53,130,107,46,49,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
