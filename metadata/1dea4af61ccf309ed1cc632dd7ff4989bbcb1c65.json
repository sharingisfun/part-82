Basically the president wants to be able to shut down the peoples ability to share information. **BEWARE** this is what China does and what the Nazi's did back in the day. Preventing the people from communicating is a good way to keep them oppressed. Also, the Obama administration has announced that they are going to start going after the pirate community, (**EDIT As of July 13th,  at least ten sites have had their URL seized. Their equipment seized. Their owners/operators arrested.) they are not talking about Somalian pirates, they are talking about us. So, if you value this freedom that we all enjoy, write your local leaders and tell them so. They are supposed to work for us, not the other way around. If you don't live in the US and think &quot;So what? Let the stupid Americans do what they want.&quot; Remember that what we are doing today your country may be doing tomorrow, so **BEWARE**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dea4af61ccf309ed1cc632dd7ff4989bbcb1c65","amp;dn":"Opie+and+Anthony+2010-07-13-O%26A-CF64K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dea4af61ccf309ed1cc632dd7ff4989bbcb1c65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,234,74,246,28,207,48,158,209,204,99,45,215,255,73,137,187,203,28,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
