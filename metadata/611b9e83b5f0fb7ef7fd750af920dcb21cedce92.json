It was Ray's first original screenplay and his first colour film.\nThe film is about an upper class Bengali family on vacation in Darjeeling,a popular hill station and resort, near Kanchenjunga. Shot in real time, the film examines the evolving relationships between the various characters. With dialogue shifting between English and Bengali among an ensemble cast, the film was a departure for Ray.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056134/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056134/&lt;/a&gt;\nRating - 7.3/10 (215 votes)\n\nLanguage - Bengali\nSubtitles - English (hardcored)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/ray3st8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/ray3st8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-10-03-09h30m07s106.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-10-03-09h30m07s106.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-10-03-09h30m46s226.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-10-03-09h30m46s226.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-10-03-09h32m10s62.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-10-03-09h32m10s62.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo\nCodec--DX50\nLength--1:37:56 (176,09 frms)\nResolution--640 x 480\nDar--1.333 (4:3)\nFPS--29.970\nBitrate--856\nQF--0.093\n\nAudio\n0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3 44100Hz  128 kb/s tot , Stereo \n\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
