It will be released on September 27, 2010 in the United Kingdom and the following day in the United States and is made up of a mix of new material and covers. Several songs, like &quot;Rocking Chair&quot; and &quot;When Somebody Thinks You're Wonderful&quot;, will be familiar to concert-goers as Clapton and his band have been performing them live already on Clapton's most recent tour.\n\nEric has said, &quot;This album wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t what it was intended to be at all.
