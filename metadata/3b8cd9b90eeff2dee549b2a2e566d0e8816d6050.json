I just made it into a single file for convenience. It includes his full album &quot;Earth Beasts Awaken&quot; plus 8 other promo songs. 192kbps. \n\nHe has an interesting voice and style of music. I associate it with nerdcore but he doesn't write about computers, networking, D&amp;D, Star Wars, etc... its more about dinosaurs, creatures, more &quot;historic&quot; things. \n\nThis is my first torrent btw. I've used TPB for 2 years but I just created an account.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b8cd9b90eeff2dee549b2a2e566d0e8816d6050","amp;dn":"The+Historian+Himself","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b8cd9b90eeff2dee549b2a2e566d0e8816d6050","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,140,217,185,14,239,242,222,229,73,178,162,229,102,208,232,129,109,96,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
