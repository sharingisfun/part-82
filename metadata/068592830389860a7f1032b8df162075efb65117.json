An assassin, a religious zealot, a mother, and a thief...just moments after being confined, it becomes clear that one of them is mortally wounded. As the minutes tick by, a battle for survival ensues where each of them is forced to examine their sordid ties to St. Julian-the building, as well as the legacy of the religious figure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:068592830389860a7f1032b8df162075efb65117","amp;dn":"Four.Stories.Of.St.Julian.2010.PROPER.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"068592830389860a7f1032b8df162075efb65117","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,133,146,131,3,137,134,10,127,16,50,184,223,22,32,117,239,182,81,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
