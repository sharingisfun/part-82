Ram and Rahim were two different characters playing role of secret agents.\nIn most of the stories their job will be to save the world from a wicked scientist\nor an enemy of their nation. A typical story will feature their mission to bring back a stolen secret file from the villain's den, before it reaches the enemy nation.\nThe choice of character's name as Ram and Rahim was also contributing towards religious harmony among children. According to one volume namely Vatann ke Dushman Rahim is \nthe son of a Pakistani colonel who defected to India after he got disillusioned by fanaticism of Pakistani armed forces, especially an officer named Fanneh Khan. \nRam is the eldest son of a highly placed Indian Intelligence beaurecrat.\nRam is a Hindu name while Rahim is a Muslim name. Both will have tremendous friendship and both will work together to save the world.\nThey have a enemy named Dr. Fomanchu.\nIn later stories, Rahim loses his one hand and has to make do with a prosthetic arm that has the same capabilities as a normal hand, but much stronger and faster.\nChildren used to wait for summer holidays in the late 80s and early 90s for special editions of Ram-Rahim's and Crookbond's comics during summer holidays.\n\nCOMICS LIST:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/48497648185723522934.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/48497648185723522934.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n029 SADABAHAR DEVANAND\n030 HAWALDAR GENDARAM AUR ANOKHA MADARI\n031 MOAM KI GUDIYAA\n035 BADLE KI AAG\n036 MAUT KI NANI\n037 MAUT MARI BEMAUT\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/56449733377737652123.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/56449733377737652123.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n032 HAILLI PUCHHAL TARA\n033 HALLI KI YATRA\n034 SPACE KING KA ANT\n038 KHOONI DARINDE\n095 MURDA SHAITAN\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/87976214078704662729.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/87976214078704662729.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n047 DAULAT KE BHOOKHE BHERIYE\n048 BHOOT KA AATANK\n070 DUNIYA MERI MUTTHI MEIN\n071 PRALAYANKARI DANAV\n\n\nTHANKS TO THE ORIGINAL UPLOADER.\nPLEASE COMMENT IF YOU LIKE THEM.\nAND AFTER DOWNLOADING PLEASE SEED .\n\nWISH YOU ALL A VERY HAPPY AND SAFE DEEPAWALI.\n-SANJEET","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14364f10770c74afb79df86c4ba25075083be717","amp;dn":"MANOJ+COMICS+%28HINDI%29+RAM-RAHIM+MISSING+COMICS+SET-07","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14364f10770c74afb79df86c4ba25075083be717","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,54,79,16,119,12,116,175,183,157,248,108,75,162,80,117,8,59,231,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
