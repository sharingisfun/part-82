A rescue hastily speeds to the returned vessel after a transmission was picked up from the ship, garbled, but vaguely resembling a human voice. As the crew reach the ship, and spend longer on it, it appears that someone or something is toying with them, and more, the question is what has the Event Horizon become?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c15e09cecb4200cc65ec8a09fcbf97bfdb765569","amp;dn":"Event+Horizon+%281997%29+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c15e09cecb4200cc65ec8a09fcbf97bfdb765569","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,94,9,206,203,66,0,204,101,236,138,9,252,191,151,191,219,118,85,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
