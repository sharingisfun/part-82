During a night, RJ tries to steal all the food reserves of Vincent, a big bear, but the raccoon's ambition makes that all the food loot get lost. Vincent warns RJ that he'll should put back all his food when full moon comes, otherwise he will regret having stolen the food. Meanwhile, a group of animals headed by a cautious turtle, Verne, is worried because spring has come and there's not enough food for everyone. Verne tells that they will be fine eating plants and some bark. Later, they find that their wood has a frontier, formed by a giant bush. They're scared of crossing to the other side, where the suburbs exist. But RJ comes to the scene, telling that there's no danger in the suburbs, and that they will find all the food they want there. Nevertheless, Verne distrusts RJ, because he thinks that there's something suspicious about him, trying to convince the group that natural food is better than junk human food. Verne won't be wrong, because RJ is only using them to get the food for Vincent. A pair of opossums, a family of porcupines, a nervous squirrel and a female skunk, will plan a risky theft to a house, drawing a lot of obstacles, like a silly exterminator, a cat and the neurotic house owner.\n\nCats :\nBruce Willis\t... \tRJ (voice)\nGarry Shandling\t... \tVerne (voice)\nSteve Carell\t... \tHammy (voice)\nWanda Sykes\t... \tStella (voice)\nWilliam Shatner\t... \tOzzie (voice)\nNick Nolte\t... \tVincent (voice)\nThomas Haden Church\t... \tDwayne (voice)\nAllison Janney\t... \tGladys (voice)\nEugene Levy\t... \tLou (voice)\nCatherine OHara\t... \tPenny (voice)\nAvril Lavigne\t... \tHeather (voice)\nOmid Djalili\t... \tTiger (voice)\nSami Kirkpatrick\t... \tBucky (voice)\nShane Baumel\t... \tSpike (voice)\nMadison Davenport\t... \tQuillo (voice)\n\nData Technical :\n!!!
