The golden-haired general and his doomed 7th Cavalry have been wiped out by Indians in more than 40 films. Yet the battle that left no white survivors also left two very different accounts of Little Big Horn: one white; one Native. Using journals, oral accounts and Indian ledger drawings as well as archival and feature films, a Native American novelist, James Welch (Winter in the Blood, The Indian Lawyer) and a white filmmaker, Paul Stekler (Eyes on the Prize) combine talents to examine this watershed moment from two views: from that of the Lakota Sioux, Cheyenne and Crow who lived on the Great Plains for generations; and from that of the white settlers who pushed west across the continent. Pulitzer Prize-winning Native American writer Scott Momaday narrates.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81865d96d71a511715ec5ca373ac005585fa4cb4","amp;dn":"Last+Stand+at+Little+Big+Horn+-+American+Experience+1993","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81865d96d71a511715ec5ca373ac005585fa4cb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,134,93,150,215,26,81,23,21,236,92,163,115,172,0,85,133,250,76,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
