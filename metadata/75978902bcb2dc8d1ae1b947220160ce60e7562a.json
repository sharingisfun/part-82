It was released as a double \n\nLP in 1972. Roadwork was the second of only three albums the band recorded together.\n\nHighlights include Winter's virtuoso keyboard and vocal work, and the guitar stylings of Rick Derringer. The longest track on the album was the band's own version of the John D. Loudermilk song, &quot;Tobacco \n\nRoad&quot;, which lasted over 17 minutes, taking up an entire side of the album. Derringer contributed lead vocals to &quot;Still Alive and Well&quot; and &quot;Back in the USA&quot;, and Johnny Winter made a special appearance \n\nsinging lead on &quot;Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo&quot;. Louisiana native Jerry LaCroix, who shared lead vocals with Winter in White Trash, is also prominently featured.\n\nThe album was recorded before live audiences at the Apollo Theater in New York and in Los Angeles at the legendary Whiskey A Go Go night club.\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n* Edgar Winter: Lead and backing vocals, Keyboards, Saxophone\n * Jerry LaCroix: Lead and backing vocals, saxophone\n * Jon Smith: Backing vocals, saxophone\n * Rick Derringer: Lead vocals, guitars\n * Randy Jo Hobbs: Bass\n * Bobby Ramirez: Drums\n * Marshall Cyr: Trumpet\n * Mike McClellan: Trumpet\n * Tilly Lawrence: Trumpet\n * Johnny Winter: Lead vocals, guitar (on &quot;Rock &amp; Roll, Hoochie Koo&quot;)\n\n\nProduction notes\n\nAt the start of their appearance at the Apollo Theater, the unidentified host who introduced them chided their evident late arrival saying (slightly off mic):\n\n&quot;Y'know, every time we used to go outta town for them jive jobs they give us, they always say 'black folks: late, can't be on time,' now look at the White Trash!&quot; (chuckle)\n\nThe comment was met with laughter from the audience. After the introduction, the audience again broke out into sporadic laughter, possibly not expecting much from the band as it consisted of all white \n\nmusicians, but their doubts were quickly dispelled when the band launched into &quot;Cool Fool&quot;, a funky R&amp;B song.\n\nThis snipet appears on the original vinyl release at the beginning of Side 4.\n\n\n1. &quot;Save the Planet&quot; \n2. &quot;Jive, Jive, Jive&quot; \n3. &quot;I Can't Turn You Loose&quot;\n4. &quot;Still Alive and Well&quot; \n5. &quot;Back in the U.S.A.&quot; \n6. &quot;Rock &amp; Roll, Hoochie Koo&quot; \n7. &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; \n8. &quot;Cool Fool&quot; \n9. &quot;Do Yourself a Favour&quot;\n10.&quot;Turn on Your Love Light&quot; \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy &amp; please don't forget to SEED!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75978902bcb2dc8d1ae1b947220160ce60e7562a","amp;dn":"Edgar+Winter%5C%27s+White+Trash-Roadwork+%281972%29Mp3+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75978902bcb2dc8d1ae1b947220160ce60e7562a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,151,137,2,188,178,220,141,26,225,185,71,34,1,96,206,96,231,86,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
