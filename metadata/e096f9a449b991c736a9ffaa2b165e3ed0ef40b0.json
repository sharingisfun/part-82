That didn't quite turn out the way I planned, but it's still a complete story with a beginning, middle &amp; end.\n\nYou can find the latest news and updates from me (11/88 Studios) at\n\nIf you like the book, please donate. The donate button is at the link above.\n\nThe book does contain water marks on every page, I encourage everyone to read it and share it. I'd rather 1,000 people read the book for free than three people read the book and donate a couple bucks.\n\nI know most people prefer to read the cbr version of the book, but if you'd prefer the pdf, it's there for you also. I will seed this forever, but it doesn't hurt for others too also.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e096f9a449b991c736a9ffaa2b165e3ed0ef40b0","amp;dn":"Growing+Pains+%231","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e096f9a449b991c736a9ffaa2b165e3ed0ef40b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,150,249,164,73,185,145,199,54,169,255,170,43,22,94,62,208,239,64,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
