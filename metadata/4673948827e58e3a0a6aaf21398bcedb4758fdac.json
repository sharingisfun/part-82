This is an unabridged version of Mary ShelleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Frankenstein, produced by Blackstone Audio. It is read by Simon Templeton, Anthony Heald, and Stephan Rudnicki. I hope you will enjoy it. \n\nI got the audio book from the library and ripped the discs with Windows Media Player. They are in mp3 format, at 128 kbps. There were 7 CDs, which ripped into 174 total files. The book is listed as being 8.5 hours long.\n\n\nHere are links to the front and back covers from the CDs;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oApDmAaCm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oApDmAaCm&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oApdNAaCM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oApdNAaCM&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4673948827e58e3a0a6aaf21398bcedb4758fdac","amp;dn":"Frankenstein%2C+or+the+Modern+Prometheus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4673948827e58e3a0a6aaf21398bcedb4758fdac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,115,148,136,39,229,142,58,10,106,175,33,57,139,206,219,71,88,253,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
