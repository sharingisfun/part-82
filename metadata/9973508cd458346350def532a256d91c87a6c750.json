Smith-influenced poetry. When I Am a Big Girl collects the band's first three EPs (1984's Cottage Industry, Weakling Lines, and Prick Up Your Ears) for the In Tape label. Mildly psychedelic flourishes surfaced on Yeah Yeah Noh's first full-length effort, 1985's Cutting the Heavenly Lawn of Greatness...Last Rites for the God of Love. However, the band broke up shortly after the follow-up EP, Temple of Convenience. In 1986, a compilation of sessions recorded for DJ John Peel, a staunch supporter of the band, was released under the title of Fun on the Lawn Lawn Lawn.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9973508cd458346350def532a256d91c87a6c750","amp;dn":"Yeah+Yeah+Noh+-+When+I+am+a+big+girl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9973508cd458346350def532a256d91c87a6c750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,115,80,140,212,88,52,99,80,222,245,50,162,86,217,28,135,166,199,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
