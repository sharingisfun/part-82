What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on RBN, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:761e0b1cf821606902ed6ef42c48ccb2c85e04a2","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+Sept+16+TH+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"761e0b1cf821606902ed6ef42c48ccb2c85e04a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,30,11,28,248,33,96,105,2,237,110,244,44,72,204,178,200,94,4,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
