The reports do not generally cover top-secret operations or European and other ISAF Forces operations.\n\nThe documents reveal the squalor&quot; of war, uncovering how many relatively small incidents have added up to huge numbers of dead civilians.\n\n15,000 additional reports will be released, with occasional redactions, as the security situation in Afghanistan permits.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aff74eaa29606137a8f5eba623bd76668e6e381b","amp;dn":"Afghan+War+Diary+2004-2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aff74eaa29606137a8f5eba623bd76668e6e381b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,247,78,170,41,96,97,55,168,245,235,166,35,189,118,102,142,110,56,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
