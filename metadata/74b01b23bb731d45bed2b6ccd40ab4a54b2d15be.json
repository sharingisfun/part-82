The map is divided into parcels of land called provinces. Each province is governed by a city and contains several &quot;Rural Areas&quot; which can be towns, farms, monasteries and coast towns. These rural areas can't be altered and are placed randomly across the map before each game. The city, however has room for several buildings which can give bonuses to the rural areas or the city itself, such as more piety in the monasteries when a church is built or a higher income from the towns when a market is present in the city. Other buildings are needed to recruit certain units (such as a sword smith for sword-wielding units or a fletcher for bow-wielding units) or to defend the city such as walls and towers. A city only has limited room for buildings. Thus, not all buildings can be built in a city and the player must carefully consider what to build for a particular city. Compared to other strategy games, building structures in KOH takes a rather vast amount of time.\n\nDETAILS \nGenre: Real-Time Strategy \nDeveloper: Black Sea Studios \nPublisher: Paradox Interactive \nRelease Date: Jun 6, 2005 \n\nMINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS \nSystem: 1 GHz Intel Pentium III or equivalent \nRAM: 256 MB \nVideo Memory: 16 MB \nHard Drive Space: 1300 MB \n\nWEBSITE: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.paradoxplaza.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.paradoxplaza.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74b01b23bb731d45bed2b6ccd40ab4a54b2d15be","amp;dn":"Knights+Of+Honor+v1.05+Portable+Edition+%5B%7E688+MB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74b01b23bb731d45bed2b6ccd40ab4a54b2d15be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,176,27,35,187,115,29,69,190,210,182,204,212,10,180,165,75,45,21,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
