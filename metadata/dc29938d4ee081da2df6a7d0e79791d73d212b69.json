Recording their 1998 debut demo with Rainer Maria's Kyle Fischer, Paris, Texas next surfaced on a split single with Baby I'm a Star before signing to Polyvinyl for a self-titled EP; the full-length So You Think It's Hot Here? followed in the autumn of 1999. Brazilliant was issued a year later.\n\nFormat: CD\nLabel: Polyvinyl Records\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie\nQuality: FLAC\n\n\nSo You Think Its Hot Here - 1999\n\n  1. Cadillac of High Hair\n  2.
