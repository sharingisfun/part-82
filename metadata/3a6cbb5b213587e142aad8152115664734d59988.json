It was the first single released from the band's third studio album, The Final Countdown, in 1986. It is the band's most recognizable and popular song. The song reached No. 1 in 25 countries, including the United Kingdom. In the United States the song peaked at No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and 18 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The single was certified Gold in the United Kingdom in 1986.\n\nThe song was based on an old keyboard riff that vocalist Joey Tempest had written as early as 1981ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“82, on a Korg Polysix keyboard he borrowed from keyboardist Mic Michaeli. In 1985, bassist John LevÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©n suggested that Tempest should write a song based on that riff. Tempest recorded a demo version of the song and played it for the other band members. At first the members expressed mixed reactions to it. &quot;When I first heard the synth intro to 'The Final Countdown', my reaction was: 'No, this is nuts. We just can't use this,'&quot; guitarist John Norum said, &quot;Thank God they didn't listen to me.&quot; &quot;Some of the guys in the band thought it was too different for a rock band,&quot; Tempest said, &quot;But in the end I fought hard to make sure it got used.&quot;\n\nThe song's lyrics were inspired by David Bowie's song &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. The sound of the keyboard riff used in the recording was achieved by using a Yamaha TX-816 rack unit and a Roland JX-8P synthesizer. &quot;I made a brassy sound from the JX-8P and used a factory sound from the Yamaha, and just layered them together,&quot; Michaeli said.\n\nWhen it was time to choose the first single from the album The Final Countdown, Tempest suggested the song &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;. Originally the band had never planned to release the song as a single, and some members wanted &quot;Rock the Night&quot; to be the first single. &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; was written to be an opening song for concerts, and they never thought it would be a hit. But when their record company Epic Records suggested that it should be the first single, the band decided to release it\n\n&quot;The Final Countdown&quot; was released in the spring of 1986 and became the most successful song from The Final Countdown on the American rock charts and as well as the band's most recognizable and popular song. It appeared on Billboard magazine's Billboard Hot 100 chart, reaching the top 10. The following week it debuted on the Mainstream Rock Tracks, where it peaked at number eighteen in its eighth week and remained on the chart until its twentieth week. The band's next hit was &quot;Superstitious,&quot; which achieved a higher chart position on the Mainstream Rock Tracks.\n\nOutside of the United States, the single was released worldwide. In Canada, the song reached the top ten on the Canadian Singles Chart. It remained in the top 10 for three weeks and became the band's highest charting song in Canada. &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; reached the UK Top 3, eventually spending two weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart in December, and was the only single from the album which would chart in the UK top 20. &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; reached number 1 in 25 countries, including France, Germany, Ireland, Sweden and Italy.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a6cbb5b213587e142aad8152115664734d59988","amp;dn":"Europe+-+The+Final+Countdown+%28Live%29+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a6cbb5b213587e142aad8152115664734d59988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,108,187,91,33,53,135,225,66,170,216,21,33,21,102,71,52,213,153,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
