Following it were &quot;Whiskey, If You Were a Woman&quot; at #2 and two consecutive Number Ones: &quot;Somewhere Tonight&quot; (written by Rodney Crowell and Harlan Howard) and &quot;Cry, Cry, Cry.&quot; After the chart success, Highway 101 was nominated and won the award for Vocal Group of the Year at the 1988 ACM and CMA Awards.\n\nHighway 101Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â² followed in 1988.
