In The Ghost Writer, \nRoth examines the tensions between literature and life, artistic truthfulness \nand conventional decency. At 23, Nathan Zuckerman has already hurt his family \nwith his autobiographical art and ruined his relationship with adultery and \ndishonesty. Visiting his reclusive idol (famed for his &quot;blend of sympathy and \npitilessness&quot;) in the Berkshires, the writer watches himself watching himself \nand attempts to confront his work and life. Events, however, have their \nrevenge, weaving more out of control than even he can anticipate or ask for.\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nThe Ghost Writer is the first novel by Philip Roth to be narrated by Nathan \nZuckerman, one of Roth's alter egos, and constitutes the first book in his \nZuckerman Bound trilogy. The novel touches on themes common to many Roth works, \nincluding identity, the responsibilities of authors to their subjects, and the \ncondition of Jews in America.\n\n* National Book Critics' Circle Award Finalist\n* Pulitzer Prize Finalist\n\n\nPhilip Roth titles in the FPL:\n\n -Goodbye, Columbus +5\t(1959)\t5 readers\n -Letting Go  \t\t(1962)\tLuke Daniels\n -When She Was Good \t(1967)\tTanya Eby\n -The Breast\t\t(1972)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Great American Novel(1973)James Daniels\n -My Life as a Man\t(1974)\tDan John Miller\n -The Professor of Desire(1977)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Ghost Writer \t(1979)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Zuckerman unbound\t(1981)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Anatomy Lesson \t(1983)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Counterlife\t(1986)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Facts: Autobio\t(1988)\tMel Foster\n -Deception \t\t(1990)\tD Colacci &amp; S Ericken\n -Patrimony\t\t(1991)\tGeorge Guidall\n -American Pastoral\t(1997)\tRon Silver\n -I Married a Communist\t(1998)\tRon Silver\n -The Dying Animal\t(2001)\tTom Stechschulte\n -The Plot Against America(2004)Ron Silver\n -Everyman\t\t(2006)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Exit Ghost\t\t(2007)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Indignation\t\t(2008)\tDick Hill\n -The Humbling\t\t(2009)\tDick Hill\n -Nemesis\t\t(2010)\tDennis Boutsikaris\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:add47786f4e4deeea25db87c42046791c6dcaed2","amp;dn":"THE+GHOST+WRITER+-+Philip+Roth.+Read+George+Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"add47786f4e4deeea25db87c42046791c6dcaed2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,212,119,134,244,228,222,238,162,93,184,124,66,4,103,145,198,220,174,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
