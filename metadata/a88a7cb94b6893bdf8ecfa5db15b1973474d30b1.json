And we're not talking about those guys who sell candles\nand wicker chairs. We're talking &quot;Tier&quot; 1 with a &quot;T.&quot; They are the best of\nthe best the elite-est of the elite. To give you an idea of just how elite\nthey are, more than 2 million Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines serve\nin our armed forces. Out of those 2 million, about 50,000 fall under the\ndirect control of Special Operations Command. Although their exact numbers\nare classified, only a few hundred out of those 50,000 make the cut as a\nTier 1 Operator. They are living, breathing, precision instruments of war.\nThey are experts in the application of violence. And out of those few\nhundred, only one, namely you, will step into the boots of one of these\nelite warriors in the hostile, unforgiving battlefield conditions in\npresent-day Afghanistan. Do you think you have what it takes to confront\na new enemy who improvises mercilessly in a new kind of war? Do you think\nyou have what it takes to be Tier 1? We dare you.\n\n1. Unrar\n2.
