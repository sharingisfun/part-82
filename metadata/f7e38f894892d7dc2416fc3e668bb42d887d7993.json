Box 572, Amagansett, Long Island, NY 11930). I can't even find a bio of this guy, let alone a Wikipedia page.\n\n\nI bought this CD at Frenchy's for $1.25, still in the original shrink wrap. I didn't know what to make of it, but my girlfriend, whose musical tastes are more Sixties/Seventies and operatic than mine, liked it. From what little I could find online, the critics hated it. So YMMV.\n\n\nRipped by Free Music CD Converter\n\n\nSample rate is 320kb/s\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n01. Blessed Are Those Who Mourn\n02. Tap Dancing Down Jackass Alley\n03. My Country Home\n04.
