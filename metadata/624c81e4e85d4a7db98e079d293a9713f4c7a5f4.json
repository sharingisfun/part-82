It's a rare game, and not very well known.  The game is a turn-based strategy game that takes place on the moons of Jupiter over mining rights. You have your basic handling of resources, alloting money for facilities, upgrades and the like. Your mission is to design, build, and produce Over Kill Engines (mechas) to defend your base, establish other bases, and take over the enemy base. Here's the catch:\n\nYou have to program the A.I.\n\nA basic understanding of programming language is definitely a great advantage to this game (but not necessary) as you'll have to design a basic program that will be the heart of your AIs function. \n\nI have included both CDs, the game disc and a movie tutorial disc.  There are two manuals included, the main manual and the tutorial manual. Extras include images of the disc art, the back and front cover of the jewel case, and a handful of pre-made programs. \n\nThere is still a cult following for this game, so join up!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:624c81e4e85d4a7db98e079d293a9713f4c7a5f4","amp;dn":"Carnage+Heart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"624c81e4e85d4a7db98e079d293a9713f4c7a5f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,76,129,228,232,93,74,125,185,142,7,157,41,58,151,19,244,199,165,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
