The authors present the theoretical foundation and participatory methodologies that unite these radical interdisciplinary approaches to creating individual and community well-being. They move from a description of the psychological and community wounds that are common to unjust and violent contexts to engaging examples of innovative community projects from around the world that seek to heal these wounds. The creation of public homeplaces, the work of liberation arts, critical participatory action research, public dialogue, and reconciliation are highlighted as embodying the values and hopes of liberation psychology. Drawing on psychoanalysis, trauma studies, liberation arts, participatory research, and contemporary cultural work, this book nourishes our understanding of and imagination about the kinds of healing that are necessary to the creation of more just and peaceful communities. In dialogue with cultural workers, writers, and visionaries from Latin America, Africa, Asia, Europe, the United States, and the Pacific Islands, Toward Psychologies of Liberation quickens a dialogical convergence of liberatory psychological theories and practices that will seed individual and community transformation.\n\nReview\n'This landmark book takes us on an unforgettable journey across disciplines, countries, spiritualities, and techniques to teach us twenty-first century psychologies of liberation. Authors Watkins and Shulman transform the discipline of psychology, showing us its connections to all disciplines concerned with liberating the imagination. Across international fields of difference, these authors never give up the prize: social and psychic emancipation. In doing so, they define what 'decoloniality' means for the twenty-first century.' - Chela Sandoval,\n\nAssociate Professor of Liberation Philosophy, Chair, Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA. 'A scholarly, heartfelt, and desperately needed re-visioning of psychology.' - Dr Craig Chalquist, JFK University, USA 'One cannot help but recommend this text with utmost enthusiasm. Although not by any means a summary of its plural subject, Toward Psychologies of Liberation can be read as multi-layered digest of the major psychological, philosophical, and theological roots of this movement, as well as a review of some of the major problems tackled by theorists and practitioners within the tradition. Watkins&amp; Shulman have crafted for us a major tour de force, broad in scope and encyclopedic in nature.' - Journal of Religion and Health 'Toward Psychologies of Liberation' provides us with a brilliant and timely compilation, in the mode of an appreciative evaluation, of these diverse strands that might be woven into the fabric of critical and progressive social science...This is a path-breaking book, and an enormous service to our scholarly community in the extensiveness and sophistication of its coverage...It is a remarkable work which deserves widespread attention.' - Barnaby B. Barratt, Psychoanalysis,\n\nCulture and Society\nProduct Description\nUnderstanding that the psychological well-being of individuals is inextricably linked to the health of their communities, environments, and cultures, the authors propose a radical interdisciplinary reorientation of psychology to create participatory and dialogical spaces for critical understanding and creative restoration.\n\nAbout the Author\nMARY WATKINS is core faculty at Pacifica Graduate Institute, USA, the author of Waking Dreams, Invisible Guests: The Development of Imaginal Dialogues, co-author of Talking with Young Children about Adoption, and co-editor of Psychology and the Promotion of Peace.
