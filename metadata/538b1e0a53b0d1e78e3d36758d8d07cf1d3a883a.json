Vladimir Makarov, a brutal leader and former associate of Imran Zakhaev, has set in motion a series of events that will threaten global security. After a series of vicious terrorist attacks, the situation is deemed dangerous enough for Task Force 141, led by Captain Soap MacTavish and Co., to be deployed all around the world, attempting to track down Makarov and restore peace.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:538b1e0a53b0d1e78e3d36758d8d07cf1d3a883a","amp;dn":"Modern_Warfare_2_7620x.darkbb.com","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"538b1e0a53b0d1e78e3d36758d8d07cf1d3a883a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,139,30,10,83,176,209,231,142,61,54,117,141,141,7,207,29,58,136,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
