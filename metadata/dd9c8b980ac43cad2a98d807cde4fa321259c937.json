No Name (Live From NAAM) (2nafish) \n\n\n\nNight Ranger is an American 1980s rock band from San Francisco that gained significant popularity during the 80s and 90s with a series of successful albums and singles. The band's first five albums sold over 10 million copies worldwide, and gave the band international recognition. The quintet is perhaps best known for the power ballad &quot;Sister Christian&quot;, which peaked at #5 in June 1984.\n\nAfter their success waned in the late 1980s, the band split up in 1989 and its members pursued other musical endeavours including both group and solo efforts. Several members released an album without original singer Jack Blades in 1995, but the band soon re-united to release two new albums in the latter half of the decade. Despite the departure of original keyboardist Alan Fitzgerald and guitarist Jeff Watson, the band has continued to tour into 2008 and remains very popular in Asian countries including Japan.\n\n\nCurrent members\n\n    * Jack Blades ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar, lead &amp; backing vocals, acoustic guitar, rhythm guitar (1979ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1989, 1996ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“present)\n    * Kelly Keagy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion, backing &amp; lead vocals (1979ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1989, 1991ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“present)\n    * Brad Gillis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead &amp; rhythm guitars, backing vocals (1979ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1989, 1991ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“present)\n    * Joel Hoekstra ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead &amp; rhythm guitars, backing vocals (2008ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“present)\n    * Christian Matthew Cullen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards, backing vocals (2007ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“present)\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd9c8b980ac43cad2a98d807cde4fa321259c937","amp;dn":"Night+Ranger+-+L.A.+No+Name+%28Live+From+NAAM%29+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd9c8b980ac43cad2a98d807cde4fa321259c937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,156,139,152,10,196,60,173,42,152,216,7,205,228,250,50,18,89,201,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
