We never see the atrocity/accident, or even the town. Word simply reaches a prospector's camp, a wood-and-canvas pimple on the blankness of the wasteland, that someone &quot;rode down a man and a little person... maybe a child.&quot; Was the someone Willett Gashade's brother Coin, who has gone missing? Was it Leland Drum, Coin's companion, who gets shot from ambush at his fireside--perhaps by an unknown avenger, perhaps by Coin? The death of Drum explains the film's title, but there's a long list of things we never know in The Shooting, and most (all?) of the characters in the movie never know them either. Still, the small, relentlessly enigmatic cast of characters gets into motion and keeps moving--chasing something, running from something, headed for somewhere that may turn out to be nowhere, or deep inside themselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5aeae8e1486d70932bb00ca225ee6f80ce8f927","amp;dn":"The.shooting.1967.DVDRip.XviD-SOFILMACOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5aeae8e1486d70932bb00ca225ee6f80ce8f927","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,174,174,142,20,134,215,9,50,187,0,202,34,94,230,248,12,232,249,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
