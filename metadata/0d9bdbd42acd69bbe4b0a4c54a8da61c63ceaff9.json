The tour was sponsored in Europe by Volkswagen, which also issued a commemorative version of its top-selling car, the Golf Pink Floyd, one of which was given as a prize at each concert. It was a standard Golf with Pink Floyd decals and a premium stereo, although it had Volkswagen's most environmentally friendly engine, at Gilmour's insistence.\n\nAC3 audio (5.1ch, 48kHz, 640kbps) demuxed, from DVD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d9bdbd42acd69bbe4b0a4c54a8da61c63ceaff9","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+P.U.L.S.E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d9bdbd42acd69bbe4b0a4c54a8da61c63ceaff9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,155,219,212,42,205,105,187,228,176,164,197,74,141,166,28,99,206,175,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
