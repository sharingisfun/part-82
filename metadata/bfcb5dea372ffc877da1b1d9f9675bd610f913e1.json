Software can't tell the difference between those transients that are in the recording and are supposed to be there and those that came from debris or defects that the needle hit during playback.  I tried many such noise/click/pop removers also called &quot;restoration&quot; and they always took away the snap from lots of things in the recording, especially noticeable with the high-hat and snare drum.  Doing it manually is very meticulous and time consuming but imho well worth it.  If I used some software and it took too much out, you can never put it back.  You want the rest removed?  It's still there, do it yourself if it bothers you that much.  I prefer a few minor glitches to having the recording damaged beyond repair.  Since this is still not available on CD, and until now not at all in any quality worth listening to for download, I hope someone else appreciates this.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfcb5dea372ffc877da1b1d9f9675bd610f913e1","amp;dn":"Billy+Thorpe+-+1991+%28320k%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfcb5dea372ffc877da1b1d9f9675bd610f913e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,203,93,234,55,47,252,135,125,161,177,217,249,103,91,214,16,249,19,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
