First and only album released in 1978, 'WEIDORJE', even if some new stuff was ready for a second album. But following difficulties to find a producer, WEIDORJE disbanded, although they were popular with the French audience. Initially constituted with three long tracks : 'ELOHIM's VOYAGE', 'VILNA' and 'BOOLDEMUG' on the Ep released for Cobra, two new tracks 'RONDEAU' and 'KOLINDA' appeared on the CD reedition by Musea in 1992 (these two tracks were released live with a bad sound but the bass solo is wonderful, waving between jazz-fusion and Zheul accents)...\n\nfrom Tauhd Zaia, FRANCE,\nhttp://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=1075","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b928fbd054f5dc87e4b4bccab1faf88f1b35d76","amp;dn":"WEIDORJE+-+1978+-+Weidorje+%28Zeuhl%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b928fbd054f5dc87e4b4bccab1faf88f1b35d76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,146,143,189,5,79,93,200,126,75,75,204,171,31,175,136,241,179,93,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
