Although most scientific journals are now highly specialized, Nature is one of the few journals, along with other weekly journals such as Science and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, that still publishes original research articles across a wide range of scientific fields. In many fields of scientific research, important new advances and original research are published as articles or letters in Nature.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:603352ae0af7f5ea17b67869eec59c1ef2a6030f","amp;dn":"Nature+Magazine+-+July+15th+2010+%28True+PDF%29+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"603352ae0af7f5ea17b67869eec59c1ef2a6030f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,51,82,174,10,247,245,234,23,182,120,105,238,197,156,30,242,166,3,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
