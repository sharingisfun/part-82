The series resembles Dancing with the Stars, but in this case the women are famous figure skaters and the men are well-known hockey players.\n\nIf you are a fan of figure skating, ice hockey or Dancing With The Stars, this show is worth a try.\n\nThe 6 remaining pairs are:\n- Patrice Brisebois and Shae-Lynn Bourne\n- Kelly Chase and Kyoko Ina\n- P.J. Stock and Violetta Afanasieva\n- Todd Warriner and Isabelle Brasseur\n- Valeri Bure and Ekaterina Gordeeva\n- Theo Fleury and Jamie SalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©\n\nTwo of the judges are the same each week: Sandra Bezik and Jeremy Roenick. The guest judge this week is Ken Daneyko.\n\nThe hosts are Kurt Browning and Ron Maclean.\n\n\nThe resolution is 624x352 and is 21:18 long. While the video quality isn't awesome, it is quite watchable in my opinion This episode aired on CBC on Oct 18, 2010. \n\nCBC has a big website for this show at http://www.cbc.ca/battle/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea8d06d4880a5e34dcc3b0c06a605e5a4cdaeeca","amp;dn":"Battle.of.the.Blades.S02E06.WS.XviD-err0001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea8d06d4880a5e34dcc3b0c06a605e5a4cdaeeca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,141,6,212,136,10,94,52,220,195,176,192,106,96,94,90,76,218,238,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
