First up, is an appearance on the &quot;Phonzeit tv program in 1975, on January,18th with timecode. There are discussion segments as indicated in the running order notes,which cut into the songs,and be forewarned: German language, and no subtitles. However, I have included an un-cut Surrounded By The Stars from the show. That's the only one available though.   \nFollowing that, is a collection of various live concert and studio performances(look closely and you'll spot David Gilmour!) including the aforementioned un-cut Surrounded By The Stars. All in all, great audio and visual quality and a real keeper for the heavy Amon Duul II fan. Thanks goes to Olvator at Dimeadozen, for the Phonzeit torrent. \n\nrunning order:\n\n01.
