Each ring regenerates shortly. These rings can serve one of three purposes.\n\n* Stepping on a speed boost will consume up to 50 of a player's rings, and boost the player ahead along a preset path. The boost is at a speed approximately three times the normal maximum speed of a character and lasts for a duration proportional to the number of rings deducted. If a character has more than 50 rings, only 50 will be used.\n* Special doors on the tracks can open if a player reaches them with twenty or fifty rings (depending on the door). Twenty-ring doors frequently hide tokens, shortcuts, or both. Fifty-ring doors frequently hide Chaos Emeralds, shortcuts, or both. After being opened, the doors remain open for all players for the duration of the race.\n\nThere are also inexhaustible emblem bonuses. Touching an emblem gives the racer one of multiple possible rewards, including a random number of rings and the water and lightning shields that appeared in Sonic the Hedgehog 3. The water shield allows the racer to walk on water once, after which it disappears. The lightning shield attracts rings to itself, but is eliminated upon touching water (or after having it for a long enough time). Another bonus is the Power Sneakers which allow a player to run double his or her normal speed for a limited amount of time.\n\nThere are five racers in each race. The four racers selected depend on what character the player chooses. If the player chooses a secret character, he'll face the other secret characters that have been unlocked. If the player chooses a starting character, he races against the other starting characters. For the purposes of selecting the racers, Dr. Robotnik is treated as a starting character.\n\nSome racers can run on water for a while, and all characters can &quot;swim&quot; in it indefinitely, at greatly reduced speed. In addition, each of the ten playable characters has a different speed and a unique set of abilities. Unlike most racing games, these abilities are designed such that certain characters, even among characters that are initially playable, have a clear edge over others.\n\nOther modes\n\nAside from the main game, there are three special gameplay modes accessible from Time Attack mode: reverse, in which racing occurs facing the opposite direction, break five balloons, and tag four players.\n\nCourses\n\nSonic R has five racetracks, based on staple Sonic level themes. The first four are playable from the start, and the final, Radiant Emerald, is unlocked by completing the initial tracks in first place with any character. In the PC version, the environment for the courses will change at random. For example, it will sometimes be raining or dark outside (If it is snowing on the course, all the water will freeze, allowing the character to walk on it).\n\n* Resort Island: The traditional tropical opening Sonic level, based around a beach environment with mountains, a waterfall and small ruins. The course song is &quot;Can You Feel the Sunshine?&quot;\n* Radical City: A night-time city that includes casino elements, among which is a giant pinball table. The course song is &quot;Living in the City.&quot;\n* Regal Ruin: An Egyptian-themed course at sunset, resembling Angel Island. The course song is &quot;Back in Time.&quot;\n* Reactive Factory: This zone is a future-set, metallic, industrial factory setting based on Robotnik's fortress. This is the only level with a &quot;fountain&quot; of rings where the player can obtain an infinite amount of rings. The course song is &quot;Work it Out.&quot;\n* Radiant Emerald: A surreal course seemingly set inside a giant Chaos Emerald in space. In the Saturn version, the course is completely translucent, but this transparency can be toggled on and off using an F-Key function in the PC version. The course song is &quot;Diamond in the Sky&quot;, but when the course is played as Super Sonic the full version of the main theme &quot;Super Sonic Racing&quot; plays. To unlock the track, the player must win in 1st place in the other race tracks.\n\nCharacters\n\nPlayable from start\n\n* Sonic the Hedgehog\n* Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower\n* Knuckles the Echidna\n* Amy Rose\n\nUnlockable\n\n* Doctor Ivo Robotnik\n* Metal Sonic\n* Tails Doll (a smaller, doll-like version of Tails)\n* EggRobo\n* Metal Knuckles\n* Super Sonic\n\nINSTALLATION:\nextract\nmount\ninstall\ncopy crack.exe to game directory\ninstall it\nplay\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDon't forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6af86c13f5f90ae7c1da42983d9d103384b043ea","amp;dn":"Sonic+R+%28Sonic+the+Hedgehog%29+%28Racing%29+%28Compressed+Nicely%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6af86c13f5f90ae7c1da42983d9d103384b043ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,248,108,19,245,249,10,231,193,218,66,152,61,157,16,51,132,176,67,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
