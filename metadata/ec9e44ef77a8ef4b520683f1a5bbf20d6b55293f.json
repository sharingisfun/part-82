Coast Guardsmen patrolled the shores of the United States engaging U-boats months before Americas official entry into the war. On June 13, 1942, Seaman Second Class John Cullen, patrolling New Jersey, discovered the first landing of saboteurs in Operation Pastorious. Cullen was the first American to actually come into contact with the enemy on the shores of the United States during the war and his report led to the capture of the german sabotage team. For thia, Cullen received the Legion of Merit. In addition to antisubmarine operations, the Coast Guards worked closely with the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. Many of the coxswains of American landing craft, such as the Higgins boat (LCVP), used in amphibious invasions were Coast Guardsmen.\n\nKustbevakningen var en enormt viktig del I den amerikanska militÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ren.
