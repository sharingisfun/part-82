It's basically been made iPod/iTunes/WMP compatible, and gone through my OCD filter (because I can't stand to have my music files unorganized). \n\nI had initially looked for a Civilization V soundtrack, but was surprised that there wasn't one available. I really wanted it, and I figured you guys would too, so I whipped this up in a couple of hours. At any rate, here you go!\n\nNotes:\nThe titles initially had either no spaces, or underscores where the spaces should have been. This is now fixed. Songs titled &quot;*title* A&quot; and &quot;*title* B&quot; have been replaced with &quot;*title* I&quot; and &quot;*title* II&quot;. Songs with alphanumeric numbers have had the numbers replaced with roman numerals as well, with the exception of &quot;Pt. X&quot; &quot;No. Y&quot; and &quot;Op. Z&quot; I've also added punctuation, and given track numbers. The music is arranged how I found it in the game folder: By civilization area (Americas, Europe, Asia, and Middle East/Africa) and then mood (At War, At Peace, Either). Each one got its own album, and they all share &quot;Civilization V&quot; as the artist.\n\nREMEMBER TO SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46bcf8a1537c8a4dd3221d101cfecbac22c30e29","amp;dn":"Sid+Meier%5C%27s+Civilization+V+Soundtrack+%28OST%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46bcf8a1537c8a4dd3221d101cfecbac22c30e29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,188,248,161,83,124,138,77,211,34,29,16,28,254,203,172,34,195,14,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
