Little do they    \n       know that a psychopathic killer has decided to play along. As they  \n       wander aimlessly through the maze the murderer follows closely     \n       behind, taunting them and watching their every move. The game      \n       turns deadly when the kids decide to separate and weaken their     \n       chances of survival. When the mutilated body of the maze owner is   \n       found they realize that something is terribly wrong. As they race   \n       to find the entrance of the maze, the murderer cleverly forces     \n       them to follow the path that he wants. Manipulating everyone to    \n       his vicious will, the killer taunts his victims and leads them     \n       further into the depths of the maze. After succumbing to hours of   \n       torture will anyone make it out of the maze...alive?               \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                     \n                                             \n                               [[ RLS NOTES ]]                            \n                                                                          \n       EnjoY!                                                             \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                     \n                                             \n                            [[ Group Information ]]                       \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                   Skilled DVDR, XviD or MP3 Rippers/Suppliers            \n                                  with 2009+                              \n                                                                          \n                            Looking for Site affils                       \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                          DONT SHARE THIS RLZ IN P2P...                   \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n               CONTACT INFO:                                              \n                                                                          \n                         What the fuck, you can find us??!!!              \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                     \n                    [zAc] 2010.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56c99ef9761fceae7adc72f1b128bc0d8a3871b2","amp;dn":"The.Maze.2010.DVDRip.XviD-zAc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56c99ef9761fceae7adc72f1b128bc0d8a3871b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,201,158,249,118,31,206,174,122,220,114,241,177,40,188,13,138,56,113,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
