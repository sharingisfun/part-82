The screenplay was written by Roy Huggins, drawn from a serial he wrote for the Saturday Evening Post. The film was reissued as Killer Bait in 1955. \n\n Lizabeth Scott ...  Jane Palmer \n Don DeFore ...  Don Blake \n Dan Duryea ...  Danny Fuller \n Arthur Kennedy ...  Alan Palmer \n Kristine Miller ...  Kathy Palmer \n Barry Kelley ...  Lt. Breach \n\n\nToo Late for Tears is a very tight film with no wasted scenes and no fluff--the very first scene takes us right into the action, and right into the marriage of Jane (Lizabeth Scott) and Alan Palmer (Arthur Kennedy).
