The volume is part of The Best American Series and is edited by Dave Eggers.\n\n  [2003] From Publishers Weekly\nIn his deliciously kooky foreword, Eggers (You Shall Know Our Velocity) describes this excellent literary compilation as a gathering of &quot;good writing from contemporary writers,&quot; but it's much more than that. The 25 pieces, previously published in glossies (the New Yorker, Atlantic Monthly, Harper's) and smaller outlets (Tin House, Alaska Quarterly Review, Nerve.com) were selected by San Francisco high schoolers, and all are worthy of the reprint they get here. \nThe eclectic assemblage of fiction, nonfiction, humor and comics alternates between serious articles, such as Mark Bowden's elaborate, exhaustive examination of Saddam Hussein (&quot;Tales of the Tyrant&quot;), and the comic brilliance of illustrator Lynda Barry, the charmingly goofy sentimentality of David Sedaris and the flippancy of the Onion's &quot;I'll Try Anything with a Detached Air of Superiority.&quot; Last year's collection was aimed at young adults, and several selections here address themes of peer pressure and children's cruelty: Ryan Boudinot's Halloween-themed &quot;The Littlest Hitler,&quot; David Drury's story of suburban misfits in &quot;Things We Knew When the House Caught Fire&quot; and Judy Budnitz's disturbing family tale &quot;Visiting Hours.&quot; The street-smart spunk of J.T. Leroy's &quot;Stuff&quot; and K. Kvashay-Boyle's &quot;Saint Chola&quot; combine with Daniel Voll's unflinching view of life in South Central Los Angeles to give the collection a dash of grit. \n\nReaders of all ages should be delighted with this literary smorgasbord. Eggers deserves credit for another first-rate collection.\n\n - - -\n[Random Amazon review]:]\n\nI bought this for a plane ride and I loved it. The fact that it mixes so many different genres is great. There are so many pieces in this collection that I never would have been exposed to had I not purchased this book, and I'm thankful I did. \n\nWithout getting into specific essays, I enjoyed almost everything featured in this book. It is a diverse group of readings, and I'd recommend it to anyone that wants to broaden his or her horizons but doesn't know how to do it. You'll feel enriched after reading this.\n\n - - -\n  [2004] From Publishers Weekly\nEggers explains this series, now in its third year: &quot;The purpose of this book is to collect good work of any kindÃƒÂ¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7c002b1df5fc4715c4d50e36225aaf83656dc2b","amp;dn":"THE+BEST+NONREQUIRED+AMERICAN+READING+2003-2004+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7c002b1df5fc4715c4d50e36225aaf83656dc2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,192,2,177,223,95,196,113,92,77,80,227,98,37,170,248,54,86,220,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
