In a      \n    remote desolate house. In the middle of snowy nowhere. But soon his      \n    special princess, Fermesk, will be joining him. Though the couple has    \n    never met, they have already fallen in love from looking at each         \n    other's photographs and talking on the phone. Their families have        \n    performed a wedding ceremony back home in Iraq, and Fermesk is put on    \n    a plane. The first encounter at the airport does not live up to their    \n    expectations, however. Neither look very much like their flattering      \n    photos would indicate. Fermesk is now a much bigger woman, and Renas     \n    isn't quite the handsome young man anymore.                              \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
