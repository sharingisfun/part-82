So you'll forgive Avalon fans if they approach The Creed with a little trepidation. After all, half of the award-winning group has left for other ventures and new arrivals Greg Long and Melissa Greene now join Jody McBrayer and Janna Long as the new Avalon. But like the Patriots and Yankees who change faces with the same successful results, Avalon has yet another winner with The Creed. Vocal chemistry, always critical to ensemble groups like Avalon, appears as stable as ever with Long adding his powerful vocals and soprano Greene capping the high end with style. In fact, Long is showcased on &quot;I Wanna Be With You,&quot; a definite radio-hit-in-the-making with an irresistible sing-along chorus, as well as the title track, a powerful statement of faith forged by the group's vocal tour-de-force. And like a true winning organization, Avalon called upon the best resources with producers Brown Bannister, Charlie Peacock, and Tedd T., and the best songwriting by approaching 20 different writers in search of material. The end result will no doubt be more awards, more radio hits, and more lives touched by this group's smooth but soulful delivery. --Michael Lyttle\n\nEncoded with dbPowerAmp Music Converter using LAME at 128kbps ABR.
