Part 2.    \n                    Fantasy drama. With Merlin gravely ill from the  \n                    Serket's poison, Morgana and Morgause continue  \n                    with their evil plan. They have mentally  \n                    incapacitated Uther and convinced his enemy,  \n                    Cenred, to invade Camelot. The fate of the  \n                    kingdom now rests on Arthur's shoulders. The  \n                    Prince and his Knights resist the invaders, but  \n                    Cenred's soldiers are not the only threat they  \n                    face.
