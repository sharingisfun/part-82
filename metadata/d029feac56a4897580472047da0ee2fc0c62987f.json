Emmet Walsh). The more Max tries to go straight, the more he is defeated by circumstance or hectored by the sadistic Frank. It becomes clear after a while that neither Max nor his fellow ex-cons will be able to survive looking for legitimate work. Max is too &quot;far gone&quot; as a human being to succeed at anything other than crime. He goes back to his old thieving ways, inveigling reformed crook Jerry Schue (Harry Dean Stanton) into helping him. A climactic &quot;big caper&quot; goes tragically awry, thanks in great part to the tragic flaws in Max's personality. Based on a novel by Edward Bunker, Straight Time  is possibly the most realistic cinematic probe into the sociopathic psyche of the career criminal. Famed theatrical director and instructor Ulu Grosbard directed, with an uncredited assist from star Hoffman; it was their second film together, after Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Straight Time.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 49mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 797 Kbps\n      Movie name : Straight Time [smokey888]\n      Movie name/Url : tehPARADOX.COM\n      Director : smokey888\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Simple@L3\n      Format settings, BVOP : No\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 49mn\n      Bit rate : 1 625 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 400 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.226\n      Stream size : 1.24 GiB (90%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 49mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 160 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Video delay : 26ms\n      Stream size : 125 MiB (9%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 26 ms (0.65 video frame)\n      Writing library : LAME3.96.1\n      Language : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078326/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078326/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nUlu Grosbard - Straight Time (1978)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d029feac56a4897580472047da0ee2fc0c62987f","amp;dn":"Ulu+Grosbard+-+Straight+Time+%281978%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d029feac56a4897580472047da0ee2fc0c62987f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,41,254,172,86,164,137,117,128,71,32,71,218,14,226,252,12,98,152,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
