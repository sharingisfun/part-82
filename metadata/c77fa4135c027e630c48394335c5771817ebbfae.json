A renowned producer and songwriter, Rupert Hine has been recording and releasing music under his own name and in bands already since the mid-60's. \n\nHis solo career culminated with the &quot;Immunity&quot; LP, (feat. contribution from female vocalist Marianne Faithfull), and &quot;Waving Not Drowning&quot; LP that was critically acclaimed then by the industry as &quot;a true innovative step in electronic pop&quot;. \n\nThe next LP was also filled with many beautiful tracks, still with collaborations from friends like the late Robert Palmer, and incredible songs like &quot;The Set up&quot;. \n\nIn 1986, he helped Howard Jones getting started, and was part of the Thinkman project (feat. the Top Ten hit &quot;The formula&quot;) that endured for 3 albums, but never became massive.\n\nHe now releases records sporadically, always with poetic lyrics written by his wife, but has concentrated since on production, for many artists, including Underworld. \n\nHe certainly is one of those people that have been greatly influencing modern pop music, but remained behind the curtain.\n\n1   Watchman, Walkman, Thinkman  4:50  \n2   Bad Angel  4:52  \n3   Never A Tear  5:20  \n4   Life Is A Full Time Occupation  3:15  \n5   Walking On My Shadow's Head  5:10  \n6   Dance Yourself Sane  4:10  \n7   Will-power  4:35  \n8   Slow Game  4:44  \n9   Voices In Local Time  5:10  \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c77fa4135c027e630c48394335c5771817ebbfae","amp;dn":"Thinkman+-+Life+Is+Full+Time+Occupation+%5B1988%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c77fa4135c027e630c48394335c5771817ebbfae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,127,164,19,92,2,126,99,12,72,57,67,53,197,119,24,23,235,191,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
