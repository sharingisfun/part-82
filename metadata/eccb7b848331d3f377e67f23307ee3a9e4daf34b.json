It was designed to explore what happens when normal expectations of play are subverted and destroyed, so the player cannot rely on the normal cues or understanding of typical FPS play. As such, it uses visual distortions, extreme audio effects, flashing lights, and disturbing imagery. It is not recommended for minors or those susceptible to motion sickness or other conditions brought on by flashing lights and audiovisual distortions. \n\nOtherwise, play late at night, on your own, wearing headphones and with the lights off.\n\n\nPATCHED VERSION 16/07/2010\n==========================\n\n***WARNING***\n\nThe original version of Korsakovia didn't come with a warning, but according to a number of emails I've received since release, it\nprobably should have. \n\nKorsakovia includes extreme audio effects, with very sudden jumps in volume and distortion. This may damage your speakers, headphones,\nears and brain, so don't crank it up too loud at first. I've got at least one set of very expensive speakers on my conscience. \n\nIt also includes strobe effects, shudders and environmental distortions that can aggravate the usual potentially harmful stuff. If you \nhave trouble playing any regular FPS games, you should probably steer clear of this one. Goes without saying that if you start feeling motion\nsickness, dizziness, nausea, etc, please stop playing immediately.\n\nFinally, Korsakovia is a horror game and contains disturbing and adult imagery. We take no responsibility for minors playing this game. This\nis a work of fiction that takes inspiration from a real-world psychological disorder and is not intended to be accurate or realistic in anyway. \nIf you are easily offended, shocked or disturbed, again, please steer clear. \n\n***\n\n\n\n==========\n\n1. Installation\n---------------\n\nYou will need the Orange Box version of Source running on your computer. If you don't have Episode Two, you won't be able to \nrun the game.\n\nRun the installation programme. This should automatically install Korsakovia onto your computer.\n\nAlternatively, unzip Korsakovia.zip into your SourceMods folder. Then quit and restart Steam. Korsakovia should appear in \nyour games list.\n\n\n\n2. System Requirements\n----------------------\n\nKorsakovia is very entity intensive. It should run fine on any machine meeting the recommended requirements for The\nOrange Box, but we have tracked some performance issues with lower-grade machines. This seems to be due to the large numbers of\nphysics-based props used in the game. See known issues and bugs below for more details.\n\n\n3. Playing Korsakovia\n---------------------\n\nKorsakovia is a survival horror mod using the standard control scheme of Half Life 2. You can move, jump, sprint, use objects and\nattack as normal. \n\nKorsakovia does use a number of visual effects. These are not bugs. In places, geometry has been deliberately deformed. This is also\ndeliberate. There are a large number of voice-over cues, many of which include distortions, static and other audio effects. This is\nalso deliberate.\n\nFinally, due to the number of entities used, we ended up using a slightly weird way of handling level transitions which means you won't\nget the 'Loading' message and the screen will just go to black whilst the levels are loading in. It hasn't crashed if this happens... \n\n\n4. Known issues and bugs\n------------------------\nA number of things are not deliberate, however. Korsakovia seems to be pushing at a capabilities of the Source engine in a number of ways,\nand whilst there are probably programming solutions to these, we didn't have the time, experience or money (or all three) to solve \nthem all. Playtesting has reported a few bugs that may crop up during play, although these don't seem to be either common or \ngeneric.\n\na) The program may crash between levels, with an error report that the program has exceeded memory. This is a result of the\nlarge numbers of entities in the levels. To resolve this, reload the game and you should be able to restart the level manually. If so, \nthe map names are (in order): hospital, warehouse, tenement, korsakovia01, korsakovia02, finallevel, finallevel2\n\nb) Double-firing voice-over triggers. We think we've found all of these, but if you find any, please let us know and we'll fix and \nre-release the map as a patch. There are over 60 voice-overs in Korsakovia, so there's always room for that one more error you didn't\nspot.\n\nc) Lagging: there are two places where lag was noticed on lower spec machines. This is not a universal problem and is a result of\nthe entity-heavy build, as above.\n\nd) Map transition errors. In early builds, there were a small number of bugs during level transitions, where either random props \nwere spawned into the new level, or the player spawned outside the map area. We believe these have been taken care of, but please \nlet us know if it happens to you!\n\n\n5. Credits\n----------\n\nKorsakovia was written and produced by Dan Pinchbeck\n\nThe environment was designed by Dan Pinchbeck and Adam Griffiths and built by Adam Griffiths \nwith additional build by Dan Pinchbeck and Ankur Shah\n\nAudio and music was by Jessica Curry (www.jessicacurry.co.uk)\n\nCoding was by Maksim Mitrofanov\n\nGenevieve Adam voiced Doctor Christine Grayson \nand \nBen Crystal voiced Christopher\n\nThe voice acting was recorded at Middle Street Studios, UK, by Phil Thompson\n\nPlaytesters were:\n\nNick Mower \nDonkey81 \nEli Just \nMaksim Mitrofanov \nBiGToM (who also debugged a level for us)\nAlbert Teng \n\n\nThis version of Korsakovia includes the 2010 patch by Doogie4Ever, who saved us from obsoletion hell courtesy of a source update for Mac users, which is\nas good a reason to hate Apple as all the others on my list. He's a star and  we owe him one. This version also includes a second patch by William Cook, \nfixing the flashlight - he is also a star...\n\n\n6. thechineseroom\n-----------------\n\nKorsakovia was developed for the earth-shattering sum of approximately Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£10,500 as an internal grant from the University of Portsmouth,\nas part of the ongoing chineseroom project into experimental FPS gaming. \n\nThe core ideas behind thechineseroom are that \n\na) there are important and interesting questions about FPS gaming that cannot be answered simply by studying and analysing commercial \ntitles, and that it's necessary to experiment and build in order to address them and\n\nb) that there's no reason why a research project shouldn't be any less playable and 'fun' than a non-research project (i.e. a 'normal' \ngame). On top of that, if you want to really make something that is true to the medium, then it should stand or fall as a game in its\nown right, and players should be able to engage with in on those terms. \n\nPrevious releases as part of the project include Dear Esther (Source), Conscientious Objector (Doom3/idTech4) and Antlion Soccer (Source).\n\nAll are available freely from www.moddb.com/members/chineseroom\n\nIf you have any questions about thechineseroom project or any of our mods, please contact me at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3e5a5f50104e57505d565c5b5d557e4e514c4a105f5d104b55&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nMore information about us can be found at\n\nwww.thechineseroom.co.uk\n\n====================\n\nThanks for playing, and please send any feedback to me at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1c787d72326c75727f747e797f775c6c736e68327d7f326977&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nEqually, if you have any improvements to the game, please feel free to send them through.
