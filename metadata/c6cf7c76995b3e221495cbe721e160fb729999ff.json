The journal has gained a worldwide reputation, demonstrated by its high ranking in the ISI Science Citation Index, as a forum for general and specialised communication between biophysicists working in different areas. The majority of reviews published are invited from authors who have made significant contributions to the field, who give critical, readable and sometimes controversial accounts of recent progress and problems in their speciality. Thematic issues are occasionally published.\n\n- journals.cambridge.org\n\nNo. 1:\npp. 1 - 65: Molecular architecture of bacterial flagellum\npp. 67 - 106: Dynamic receptor superstructures at the plasma membrane\n\nNo. 2:\npp. 177 - 193: Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels--structural basis of ligand efficacy and allosteric modulation\n\nNo. 3:\npp. 195 - 240: Structures of RNA-binding proteins\npp. 241 - 277: The Hofmeister series--salt and solvent effects on interfacial phenomena\n\nNo. 4:\npp. 279 - 331: Protein identification in the post-genome era--the rapid rise of proteomics\npp. 333 - 364: From membrane to molecule to the third amino acid from the left with a membrane transport protein\npp. 365 - 429: Infrared spectroscopy of proteins and peptides in lipid bilayers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6cf7c76995b3e221495cbe721e160fb729999ff","amp;dn":"Quarterly+Review+of+Biophysics%2C+Volume+30","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6cf7c76995b3e221495cbe721e160fb729999ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,207,124,118,153,91,62,34,20,149,203,231,33,225,96,251,114,153,153,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
