So for them, I've create this solution.\n\nJust select multiple files/folders and drag and drop them in my program and it'll automatically create thumnails: be it 10 movies, 100 movies no problem. whether its in a same folder or in the 10th level subfolder of a folder no problem, it'll search all media files and create thumbnails for it! Even if some of those subfolders have non-media files; don't worry, my program will skip them and work flawlessly.\nAnd yes if you want\nThumbnails can be created and saved in a ZIP file! hence you can directly zip-upload it to picswan/ imagebam or whatever your favorite imagehost site it!\n\nconsider the time, keyboard strokes and mouseclicks saved! just drag and drop.\n\nSupported video formats:-\n.3gp,.3g2,.asf,.avi,.dat,.divx,.dsm,.evo,.flv,.m1v,.m2ts,.m2v,.m4a,.mj2,.mjpg,.mjpeg,.mkv,.mov,.moov,.mp4,.mpg,.mpeg,.mpv,.nut,.ogg,.ogm,.qt,.swf,.ts,.vob,.wmv,.xvid\n\nPrinciple\nit uses MTN thumbnailer which is a commandline thumbnail creator software. I've provided a 'User friendly' GUI support to it via Autohotkey script.\nfor zipping the screenshot/thumbnails, I've given built-in commandline version of 7zip. don't worry you don't have to remember or type any commands any where. all you've to do is drag and drop single time!\n\nOptions\nyou can set the Movie screenshot's number of\nRows\nHeight\nColumns\njpeg quality\nand more...\n\nI'm especially thankful to\n#1\nMr.Tuit for creating the movie thumbnailer (mtn) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://moviethumbnail.sourceforge.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://moviethumbnail.sourceforge.net/&lt;/a&gt;\nmy software only provides GUI to his software\nmtn is developed by tuit (tuitfun); though most of its magic is actually done\nby FFmpeg libraries.

This software basically works on FFmpeg libraries.so you need to download and install a codec package like Vistacodec or K-Lite Megacodec to fix the problem. both are free.\nReason:2- may be your video file or output folder has UNICODE names like chinese,arabic etc. Be sure that all file and folder names are English only.\nany other glitch, Post it on forum.\n~~~~~~~~~~~\nI dedicate my this macro/GUI/software or whatever you wish to call it, to my favorite porn uploaders\n1. Exmnova\n2. Brego45\n3. Dias_VLD\n4. ATKFanii aka Skullmanwoopt\nand all those countless skulled and non-skulled gentleman-uploaders on piratebay like Malestorm, Umbrella_tears etc. in every category who have made our lives so easier. \n\nSuprbay disscussion thread below for any technical support  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=67971&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=67971&lt;/a&gt;\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4582da4714ea9e66c30d3c2f133f4bb5f242b8c0","amp;dn":"Ekarth_Bulk_Movie_thumbnail_Maker_%28Drag-n-Drop%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4582da4714ea9e66c30d3c2f133f4bb5f242b8c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,130,218,71,20,234,158,102,195,13,60,47,19,63,75,181,242,66,184,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
