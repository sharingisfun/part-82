Mason clearly has considerable songwriting talent, but it is spread a little too thin over the course of the whole album. The stand out track is 'Oxygen', a simple but stunning song, reminiscent of John Lennon's 'Imagine' as both an optimistic manifesto for the future and a call-to-arms to the current generation. But for every 'Oxygen' there is a 'Letter #1' or 'Our Town', songs which miss the mark. Overall, I would say this album is worth investigating, just don't expect consistently great songs. I just hope Mason's potential is fulfilled in the future. \n\nHighlights: Oxygen, Hard Hand To Hold, Where The Humans Eat\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ffecfcc0170de1b15bf5a097df3851985c28ca8","amp;dn":"Willy+Mason...Where+the+Humans+Eat%282004%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ffecfcc0170de1b15bf5a097df3851985c28ca8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,254,207,204,1,112,222,27,21,191,90,9,125,243,133,25,133,194,140,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
