When a teenage girl is found  \n                    dead, the police cannot be sure a crime was  \n                    committed. But the girl's mother is convinced  \n                    that her daughter was raped, and further  \n                    investigation uncovers a murder weapon and a  \n                    possible suspect. Senior crown prosecutor James  \n                    Steel remembers this particular suspect well -  \n                    and he is positive the man is guilty. Steel  \n                    pursues him with every power available to him,  \n                    pushing the law to its limit. Is Steel's  \n                    instinct correct or is he persecuting an  \n                    innocent man?                            \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f00d3c26b6c85bf7e7cebc662070ba4364ddbcf","amp;dn":"Law.And.Order.UK.S03E02.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f00d3c26b6c85bf7e7cebc662070ba4364ddbcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,0,211,194,107,108,133,191,126,124,235,198,98,7,11,164,54,77,219,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
