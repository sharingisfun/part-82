Over the next decade, through a combination of leaks, bootlegs and legend, those sessions would become something much more. &quot;People have been talking about these tapes ever since I recorded them,&quot; Chris Knight says. &quot;To me, they were rough and stark and I never thought they'd see the light of day.&quot; Ten years and four acclaimed albums later, The Trailer Tapes remain a remarkable moment in time, less captured than cornered, a portrait of the artist as a ferociously talented young man. And for the artist The New York Times would soon call 'the last of a dying breed...a hard-nosed iconoclast with an acoustic guitar and a college degree,&quot; The Trailer Tapes have now arrived as the long-long missing first chapter of one of the most uncompromising careers in music today. \n\n\n\n\n\nI don;t mind sharing what was given to me. I ask that if you like this album buy it. it can be found on amazon.
