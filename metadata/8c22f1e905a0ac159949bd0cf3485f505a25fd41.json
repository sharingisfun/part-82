After they are plagued by a series of silent phone calls someone enters Jan's houseboat and turns on all the gas taps. Over the months the couple are bombarded with warped text messages,expressing desire for Jan and threatening Debbie with the stark 'U Be Dead' and similar death threats.The stalker even cancels their wedding by phone as well as ringing their families. The police trace the caller,Maria Marchese,an Argentinian shop worker whose ex-boyfriend was a patient of Jan but she denies everything and the Crown Prosecution Service feel there is insufficient evidence to try her. By now Jan has left Debbie for the younger Bethan but his ordeal intensifies as he is arrested on charges of doping and raping Maria,for which he stands trial. She even has him suspended from work,sending him the triumphant text 'Got U'. But has she got him? Or,at his trial,will her lies be exposed and will she be the one who ends up behind bars?\n\nCats :\nDavid Morrissey\t ... \tDr. Jan Falkowski\nAlex Lowe\t... \tDrew Langdon\nTara Fitzgerald\t... \tDebra Pemberton\nDearbhla Molloy\t... \tDr. Bernice Falkowska\nMichael Elwyn\t... \tProf. Wojciech Falkowski\nThomas Craig\t... \tDC Lee Rutter\nAlexis Zegerman\t... \tGemma\nRichard Lumsden\t... \tDI Steven Thorpe\nLucy Griffiths\t... \tBethan Ancell\nSusannah Wise\t... \tLaura\nJan Francis\t... \tIrene Pemberton\nJohn McArdle\t... \tBrian Pemberton\nKate Steavenson-Payne\t... \tHelena\nMonica Dolan\t... \tMaria Marchese\nDavid Groves\t... \tDamian Falkowski\n\nData Technical :\n!!!
