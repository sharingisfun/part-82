(TAPESTRY, after all, was the biggest-selling album of all time until SATURDAY\nNIGHT FEVER came along.) Still, RHYMES AND REASONS is on its own merits a fine\nalbum. Although it had no hits as big as &quot;It's Too Late&quot; or &quot;Where You Lead,&quot; the high points\non this album are just as artistically satisfying. The best-known track is probably the moving,\nalmost hymn-like &quot;Been To Canaan,&quot; which has remained an important part of King's\nrepertoire in the years since. However, the album's twin highlights are a pair of gorgeous\nballads, &quot;Goodbye Don't Mean I'm Gone&quot; and the hushed &quot;I Think I Can Hear You.&quot;\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBy R. L. Church Jr. @ amazon\n\nI consider this album the masterpiece of Carole King's art. While Tapestry is one of the most\nfamous and popular albums of all time, because many of the cuts hit home so hard. I've\nknown many people especially men who find the album depressing. Rhyhmes &amp; Reasons is\nmore uplifting. It's one of the first CD's I bought to replace a worn out album. For couples, you\nshould be playing &quot;THe Frist Day in August&quot; every July 31st.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_King&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_King&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAll songs are by Carole King unless otherwise noted\n  \n  01. &quot;Come Down Easy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06 [Carole King, Toni Stern]\n  02. &quot;My My She Cries&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:19 [King, Stern]\n  03. &quot;Peace in the Valley&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23 [King, Stern]\n  04. &quot;Feeling Sad Tonight&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13 [King, Stern]\n  05. &quot;The First Day in August&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:50 [King, Charles Larkey]\n  06. &quot;Bitter with the Sweet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:29\n  07. &quot;Goodbye Don't Mean I'm Gone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n  08. &quot;Stand Behind Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:29\n  09. &quot;Gotta Get Through Another Day&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:35\n  10. &quot;I Think I Can Hear You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n  11. &quot;Ferguson Road&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:40 [Gerry Goffin, King]\n  12. &quot;Been to Canaan&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38 [#24 pop and #1 AC]\n\n\nPlaying Time.........: 00:35:47\nTotal Size...........: 180.81 MB &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img63.imageshack.us/img63/989/37963846.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img63.imageshack.us/img63/989/37963846.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPersonnel\n\nCarole King ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, piano, clavinet, Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer\nCharles Larkey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ electric bass, string bass\nHarvey Mason ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, vibraphone\nBobbye Hall ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ tambourine, shaker, bells, bongo drum, conga drum\nDaniel Kortchmar ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ electric guitar\nDavid T.
