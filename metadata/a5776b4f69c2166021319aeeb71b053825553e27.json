So far ten episodes of season one\nare complete, with three more to be done. \n\nI have now idea how many of the 68 total episodes I will complete. As usual I enclose those phrases or words which are uncertain with parentheses. \n\nIf you double-click on the subtitle file you will get a complete display of all\nthe dialogue. This is a valuable tool for reviewing the words spoken. The speech is delivered much too fast for easy understanding. It is useful to have some idea in advance of what will be heard.\n\nDon\\'t forget, these subtitle files are yours to do with as you see fit.\nI will submit them to the various subtitle websites, which will in turn do with\nthem what they will. They may revise and reissue them under their name in\nsomewhat modified form. But, here in my house, the format in which I upload\nthem will remain the same and be used for only my family.\n\n\nInformation about the whole series at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.updown.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.updown.org.uk/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLyrics of the songs at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.updown.org.uk/sounds/lyrics.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.updown.org.uk/sounds/lyrics.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\njgordon20904\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d1bbb6bea3b5bebfe3e1e8e1e591b2bebcb2b0a2a5ffbfb4a5&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5776b4f69c2166021319aeeb71b053825553e27","amp;dn":"Upstairs%2C+Downstairs+subtitle+update+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5776b4f69c2166021319aeeb71b053825553e27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,119,107,79,105,194,22,96,33,49,154,238,183,27,5,56,37,85,62,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
