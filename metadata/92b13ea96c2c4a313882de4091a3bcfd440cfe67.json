They sound alot like At the Drive in or a milder version of the Mars Volta.  It is amazing the depth of sound they create with 2 guys.  \n\nIf you like the album, I suggest you support the band by buying the CD on Bandcamp:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tarkusattacks.bandcamp.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tarkusattacks.bandcamp.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\neither that or go see them when they play near you.. they travel the midwest, but not too often.\n\nDisclaimer: I was told by Chris and Nate that I could put this up for download so don't be afraid... DL and share!\n\n\nBTW.. they want to be defined as &quot;storming the castle&quot; rock","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92b13ea96c2c4a313882de4091a3bcfd440cfe67","amp;dn":"Tarkus+Attacks%21+-+In+the+Valley+of+Elah","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92b13ea96c2c4a313882de4091a3bcfd440cfe67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,177,62,169,108,44,74,49,56,130,222,64,145,163,188,253,68,12,254,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
