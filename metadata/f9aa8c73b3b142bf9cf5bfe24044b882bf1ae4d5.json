Though he never publicly renounced his faith or abandoned religious imagery, Infidels gained much attention for its focus on more personal themes of love and loss, in addition to commentary on the environment and geopolitics.\n\nThe critical reaction was the strongest for Dylan in years, almost universally hailed for its songwriting and performances. The album also fared well commercially, reaching #20 in the US and going gold, and #9 in the UK. Still, many fans and critics were troubled by several songs inexplicably cut from the album just prior to mastering - primarily &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot;, considered a career highlight by many critics, and not officially released until it appeared on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“3 eight years later.\n\nBeginning with Infidels, Dylan ceased to preach a specific religion, revealing little about his personal religious beliefs in his lyrics. In 1997, after recovering from a serious heart condition, Dylan said in an interview for Newsweek, &quot;Here's the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else...I don't adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all of that. I've learned more from the songs than I've learned from any of this kind of entity.&quot;\n\nThough Infidels is often cited as a return to secular work (following a trio of albums heavily influenced by born-again Christianity), many of the songs recorded during the Infidels sessions retain Dylan's penchant for Biblical references and strong religious imagery. An explicit example of this is the opening track, &quot;Jokerman&quot;. Along with the Biblical and religious references, however, are lyrics about populists who are too concerned with the superficial, (&quot;Michelangelo could've carved your features&quot;) and more about action than thinking through the complexities (&quot;fools rush in where angels fear to tread&quot;). A number of critics have called Jokerman a sly political protest, addressed to a &quot;manipulator of crowds...a dream twister.&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9aa8c73b3b142bf9cf5bfe24044b882bf1ae4d5","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Jokerman+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9aa8c73b3b142bf9cf5bfe24044b882bf1ae4d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,170,140,115,179,177,66,191,156,245,191,226,64,68,184,130,191,26,228,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
