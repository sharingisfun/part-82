For 17 days no one knew whether they were alive or dead. Miraculously, after all hope was lost, on the 17th day the specialist drilling rigs looking for signs of life smashed through into the tunnel where the men had been clinging on. All 33 of the men were alive and well. Channel 4 were given unprecedented access to the drilling rigs, engineers and medics for the definitive story of how this audacious rescue was carried out.\n\n\nFile Information\nFile Name:.....Buried Alive.The Chilean Mine Rescue.20101027.andyx.tbz.avi\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):.....46:41.120\nFile Size (in bytes):.....398,716,928\n\nContainer Information\nBase Type:.....AVI(.AVI)\n\nVideo Information\nVideo Codec Name:.....XviD 1.1.2 Final\nVideo Duration:.....46:41.120\nframe Width (pixels):.....624\nframe Height (pixels):.....352\nPixel Aspect Ratio:.....1.000\nDisplay Aspect Ratio:.....1.773\nframes Per Second:.....25.000\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):.....1001\n\nAudio Information\nAudio Codec:.....0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Sample Rate:.....48000 Hz\nAudio BitRate Type:.....CBR\nAudio Channels:.....2\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):.....128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:644eb9f94e83bfc7f65cecc5a171c992fd96dccd","amp;dn":"Buried+Alive%3A+The+Chilean+Mine+Rescue+%2827th+October+2010%29+%5BPDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"644eb9f94e83bfc7f65cecc5a171c992fd96dccd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,78,185,249,78,131,191,199,246,92,236,197,161,113,201,146,253,150,220,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
