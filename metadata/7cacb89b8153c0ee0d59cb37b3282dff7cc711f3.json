It is often shared as \\&quot;\\&quot;Hir\\&quot; - Poem @ transgendered\\&quot;, but credit to the two poets is rarely given, so let it be known that this powerful piece was by Alysia Harris &amp; Aysha El Shamayleh. It vividly brings to life the emotions of transgendered individuals everywhere. Whether it taken down because of the message it so successfully spreads, or because they want to retain a monopoly over the video, just as the copyright laws which allow them to take it down were made for, it is still censorship. So, please pass this on, and upload a copy somewhere else.
