While sliding through an imaginary river Quaqquao sings a joyful tune with his quack-quack duck sound. The encounter of Quaqquao with other animals generates a playful carousel of different habits and sounds that inevitably leads them to learn something from each other. So the same song that Quaqquao was singing at the beginning eventually translates into the new acquired sound language. Each episode features a new and originally speaking origami-animal whom Quaqquao shall meet and play with.\n\n26 video episodes of 5 minutes\nAge: 0-6\nLanguage: no dialogues (non-verbal, onomatopoeic language)\nAuthor: Francesco Misseri\n\nSample episode - The Horse: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD9bJEgN7nA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b584791fe0f79d40cecd3c1a152b05820e861af","amp;dn":"QUAQQUAO+duckling+-+videos+for+kids","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b584791fe0f79d40cecd3c1a152b05820e861af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,88,71,145,254,15,121,212,12,236,211,193,161,82,176,88,32,232,97,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
