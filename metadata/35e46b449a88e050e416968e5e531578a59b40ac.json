Dateline's Mark Davis was filming as Assange prepared to release his massive cache of highly classified US documents and as he weathered the media storm that followed.\n\nThe documents reveal hundreds of civilian casualties, secret hit squads to track and kill Taliban leaders, a steep increase in Taliban attacks, and collusion between Pakistan's intelligence service and the Taliban leadership. Davis first connected with the mysterious whistleblower in Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Australia for a story broadcast in May, called The Whistleblower.\n\nThis time he has been filming in London where Assange was working with journalists from The Guardian, The New York Times and Germany's Der Spiegel. The release of the documents has rocked the White House and drawn comment from Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Some of the classified reports refer to Australia's military operations in Afghanistan.\n\nIn a move that will further shake governments and top military brass around the world, WikiLeaks says they have delayed the release of a further 15,000 reports, but these will eventually be released in full.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35e46b449a88e050e416968e5e531578a59b40ac","amp;dn":"Dateline+-+20100801+-+Inside+Wikileaks%2C+Julian+Assange+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35e46b449a88e050e416968e5e531578a59b40ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,228,107,68,154,136,224,80,228,22,150,142,94,83,21,120,165,155,64,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
