What people fail to realize is the skill that is put into this album. Sure the work is different, but it shows the unique talents of the band showing their ability to play different types of music. People who dislike this album just want to hear the basic blues that some Ten Years Songs are. But you have to listen the bass sounds in Sad Song, and some of the work with the guitar playing with the bass a little bit. This album took a while to grow on me, and I seem to enjoy music more when it seems to grow on me than liking it right away. THIS ROCKS.\n\nTracklisting:\n\n\n1. GOING TO TRY 4.31\n2.
