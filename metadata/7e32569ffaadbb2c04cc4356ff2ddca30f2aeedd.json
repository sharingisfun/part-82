An Industrial metal hit written by Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez, and produced by Trent Reznor, Dave Ogilvie and Manson, its lyrics discuss two major themes: what Manson refers to as &quot;the culture of beauty&quot;, and that culture's connection to Friedrich Nietzsche's theory of master-slave morality ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the song's &quot;weak ones&quot;, who are &quot;always wrong&quot;, are oppressed by and exist solely to &quot;justify the strong&quot;; the kratocratic beautiful people whose power is &quot;relative to the size of [the] steeple&quot;.\n\nThe single peaked at number 26 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and remains known as one of Marilyn Manson's most famous and most successful original songs; in a 2004 review, Richard Banks of the BBC called the track &quot;still the most impressive&quot; in the band's catalogue, and it was ranked in 2006 at number 28 on VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs.\n\nThe song is also available as DLC for Guitar Hero 5 and will be included in the Rock Band 3 soundtrack.\n\nFloria Sigismondi directed what has been described as &quot;the creepiest of creepy videos&quot; for &quot;The Beautiful People&quot;. The clip, filmed in the abandoned Goodenham and Worts distillery in Toronto, Canada, depicts the band performing the song in a classroom-like area decorated with medical prostheses and laboratory equipment. Intercut with these performance clips are scenes of lead singer Marilyn Manson in a long gown-like costume and aviator goggles, wearing stilts and prosthetic makeup which make him appear bald and grotesquely tall; after being placed in this costume by similarly-attired attendants, he appears to a cheering crowd through a window in a scene reminiscent of a fascist rally, and later stands in the center of a circle while people crowd around him riot. Other fast cut  scenes include extreme close-ups of crawling earthworms, mannequin heads and hands, and the boots of people marching; and shots of the individual band members bizarrely costumed, including Manson in black and neck braces and an apparent dental device which pulls the flesh of his mouth with hooks, exposing metallic teeth.\n\nThe video premiered on MTV on September 22, 1996 and was nominated for two 1997 MTV Video Music Awards: Best Rock Video and Best Special Effects.\n\n&quot;The Beautiful People&quot; was written in 1994; the lyrics are by Marilyn Manson and the music by Twiggy Ramirez. The original four-track demo version was recorded, in a hotel room while on tour, by Manson, Ramirez, and drummer Ginger Fish. Manson recalled to Kerrang!  magazine in May 2005: &quot;It was somewhere in the South, which is ironic. I remember playing the drum beat on the floor and then having my drummer duplicate that on the drum machine. It happened in one day pretty much&quot;.\n\nThe title of the song comes from Marylin Bender's 1967 book The Beautiful People, which exposed the world of scandal within the &quot;jet-set&quot; lifestyle of the 1960s, and the culture of beauty as it pertained to fashion and politics. The phrase itself was popularized by Vogue magazine in the early 1960s and was particularly used to describe the Kennedy family, a frequent source of inspiration in Marilyn Manson's work.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e32569ffaadbb2c04cc4356ff2ddca30f2aeedd","amp;dn":"Marilyn+Manson+-+The+Beautiful+People+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e32569ffaadbb2c04cc4356ff2ddca30f2aeedd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,50,86,159,250,173,187,44,4,204,67,86,255,45,220,163,15,42,238,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
