The blank tapes were Kodak and Sony brands with the number L-750. This segment focused on using the Betamax player while providing a brief history.\n\n&quot;Vocoding with the Stylophone&quot; used a Stylophone available from Thinkgeek, http://www.thinkgeek.com/electronics/musical-instruments/aa64/ . The Stylophone was hooked through the computer using the headphone jack on the stylophone and the line-in jack on my computer's sound card. Programs featured in the segment were Audacity via http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ , Zerius Vocoder via http://www.epiphyte.ca/code/vocoder.html , and Spectro via http://spectro.enpts.com/ . The segment talked briefly about the Stylophone's use as an instrument and then demonstrated the ability to use it as a post-recording vocoder tool in the style of bands such as Daft Punk and Electric Light Orchestra.\n\n&quot;Reel-to-Reel Players&quot; used a Concord Tape Recorder, a Tandberg 3300X, and an Akai GX-2300. This segment also made use of a Helix HX-4635 Boombox which is also known in other markets as a Conion C-100F and a Claritone 7980. An iPod Video was used briefly to show the recording capabilities. The segment mainly focused on showcasing the players as well as showing record and playback abilities.\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://obsoleet.noobelodeon.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://obsoleet.noobelodeon.org&lt;/a&gt; for more information.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e1a44fe03ce20b564ef21c6234e9dfd4835dae5","amp;dn":"Obsoleet+S01E03+%28Independent+amateur+internet+retro+tech+show%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e1a44fe03ce20b564ef21c6234e9dfd4835dae5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,26,68,254,3,206,32,181,100,239,33,198,35,78,157,253,72,53,218,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
