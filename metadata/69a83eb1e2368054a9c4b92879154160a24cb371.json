I have an AVERMEDIA video input card and is says it is 720 X 480. I selected &quot;best&quot; quality amd MPEG-2.  The file size reflects the better quality, but I do not know how to varify it.\n\nI uploaded the AVI because of file size.  I did all the LDs originally as MPG2 Best so can upload others if there is interest.\n\nThis LaserDisc was done as a documentary of the Beatles.  There is a Lot of early material from Liverpool, Germany and the original trip to the US and the Ed Sulivan as well as the later material.\n\nI have seen lots of the later Beatles clips and material, but never this much of the formative years.\n\nFront and Back Cover art.\n\n\nEnjoy and PLEASE seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69a83eb1e2368054a9c4b92879154160a24cb371","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Beatles+High+res","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69a83eb1e2368054a9c4b92879154160a24cb371","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,168,62,177,226,54,128,84,169,196,185,40,121,21,65,96,162,76,179,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
