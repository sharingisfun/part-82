The music swings hard and is highlighted by &quot;Besame Mucho,&quot; &quot;Days of Wine and Roses,&quot; &quot;Canadian Sunset&quot; and &quot;The Breeze and I.&quot; Enjoyable if not essential. [Originally released in 1963, Boss Guitar has been reissued several times on CD.] ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nWhat's amazing about this session is the way Wes carries it from begining to end... Wes is upfront throughout... relaxed, smoking and creatively vibrant... before Mel Rhyne even gets his first word in Wes has soulfully breezed through the duration of a 5 minute guitar solo, each chorus as interesting if not more interesting than the next. - - Jimmy Cobb's bright and sizzling drumming does nothing but help... Today Mel Rhyne is one of the strongest organists around with a full, heavy grooving, heavy swinging and amply commanding sound both as an accompaniest and a soloist - - however, on this session it is clear that Wes is the Boss... however, accompanied in more than adequate company... backed by a rhythm section that is tight, yet flowing and responsive at the same time. You get the feeling that these home town cats have worked together before ! From the beauty of CANADIAN SUNSET to the frenzic licks of THE TRICK BAG the album sounds fresh and modernsitic even even almost 40 years later - - if ever a &quot;prototypical&quot; Jazz session was recorded... this one belongs near the top of the list ! ~ Eddie Landsberg, Amazon.com\n\nPersonnel:\nWes Montgomery (Guitar) \nMel Rhyne (Organ) \nJimmy Cobb (Drums) \n\nWes Montgomery - Boss Guitar Tracks:\n01  Besame Mucho (Consuelo VelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡zquez/Sunny Skylar) 6:32 \n02  Besame Mucho (Take 2) (Consuelo VelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡zquez/Sunny Skylar) 6:24 \n03  Dearly Beloved (Jerome Kern/Johnny Mercer) 4:52 \n04  Days Of Wine And Roses (Henry Mancini/Johnny Mercer) 3:50 \n05  The Trick Bag (Wes Montgomery) 4:27 \n06  Canadian Sunset (Norman Gimbel/Eddie Heywood) 5:08 \n07  Fried Pies (Wes Montgomery) 6:45 \n08  Fried Pies (Take 1) (Wes Montgomery) 6:35 \n09  The Breeze And I (Al Stillman/Ernesto Lecuona) 4:11 \n10  For Heaven's Sake (Donald Meyer/Elise Bretton/Sherman Edwards) 4:39 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b720306d2c469bc3c45a154735155816b47741f8","amp;dn":"Wes+Montgomery+-+Boss+Guitar+%281963%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bflac%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b720306d2c469bc3c45a154735155816b47741f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,32,48,109,44,70,155,195,196,90,21,71,53,21,88,22,180,119,65,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
