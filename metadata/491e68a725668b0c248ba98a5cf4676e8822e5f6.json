Before he plays each song he normally plays some archival footage of The Beatles linked with the song. This torrent contains these archival pieces and not the songs themselves. This collection covers the songs from &quot;Good Day's Sunshine&quot; to &quot;Three Cool Cats&quot;. I will be adding more files each week as more are broadcast. If anyone has any digital or taped recordings of episodes not included here please contact me and hopefully I can add them. Thanks, happy sharing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:491e68a725668b0c248ba98a5cf4676e8822e5f6","amp;dn":"A-Z+of+the+Beatles+from+radio+2+Sounds+of+the+60s+%28G-T%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"491e68a725668b0c248ba98a5cf4676e8822e5f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,30,104,167,37,102,139,12,36,139,169,138,92,244,103,110,136,34,229,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
