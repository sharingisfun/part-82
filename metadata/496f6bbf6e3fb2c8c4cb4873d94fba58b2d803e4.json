Back at home, however, their idyllic life is upset when they discover their neighbors could be assassins who have been contracted to kill the couple.\n\n\nPlot: Spencer Aimes (Kutcher) is just your average, undercover, government-hired super-assassin accustomed to a life of exotic European locales, flashy sports cars and even flashier women. But when he meets Jen Kornfeldt (Heigl), a beautiful, fun-loving computer tech recovering from a bad break-up, he finds true love...and happily trades international intrigue for domestic bliss. Three years later, Spencer and Jen are still enjoying a picture-perfect marriage - that is, until the morning after Spencer's 30th birthday. That's when Spencer and Jen learn he's the target of a multi-million dollar hit. Even worse, the hired killers have been stalking the happy couple for years, and could be anyone: friends, neighbors, the grocery store clerk, even that crabby old guy shuffling across the street. Now Spencer and Jen are on the run for their lives. As their suburban paradise turns into a paranoid game of dodge-the-bullet, they must find out who wants Spencer dead and why, all the while trying to save their marriage, manage his in-laws, keep up neighborly appearances ... and just plain survive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:496f6bbf6e3fb2c8c4cb4873d94fba58b2d803e4","amp;dn":"Killers.2010.R5.LINE.XviD-iLG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"496f6bbf6e3fb2c8c4cb4873d94fba58b2d803e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,111,107,191,110,63,178,200,196,203,72,115,217,79,186,88,178,216,3,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
