Reduce hardware\ncosts by 50% or more by running multiple operating systems\n.  simultaneously on a single physical PC. Automate and\n:  streamline tasks to save time and improve productivity.\n\nWhy Choose VMware Workstation?\nFrom the creator of PC virtualization comes the most\nreliable, secure way to run multiple operating systems at\nthe same time. Winner of more than 50 industry awards,\nVMware Workstation transforms the way technical\nprofessionals develop, test, demo, and deploy software.\nVMware Workstation is an integral component of any serious\ntechnical professional's toolkit.\n\nMost Advanced Virtualization Platform\nVMware Workstation provides the most dependable, high\nperforming, and secure virtual machine platform. It offers\nthe broadest host and guest operating system support, the\nrichest user experience, and the most comprehensive feature\nset.\n\nRun More Operating Systems\nWith support for over 200 operating systems including\nWindows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and over 20 other\nversions of Windows, along with Redhat, Ubuntu, OpenSuse\nand 26 additional versions of Linux. VMware Workstation\ndelivers the broadest guest platform support for running\nmultiple operating systems at the same time on your PC.\n\nIndispensable Tool for Professionals\nAutomate and streamline tasks to save time and improve\nproductivity. Run applications in Linux, Windows, and more\nat the same time on the same PC with no rebooting. Evaluate\nand test new operating systems, applications and patches in\nan isolated environment. Demonstrate complex software\napplications on a single laptop in a repeatable, reliable\nmanner. Rich integration with Visual Studio, Eclipse, and\nthe SpringSource Tool Suite make it incredibly easy to\ndebug applications on multiple platforms.\n\nMore Reasons at a Glance\nSeamlessly Integrated:\nUnity mode integrates applications from within your Windows\n&amp; Linux virtual machines and makes them appear like they\nare running on your native desktop. User friendly features\nsuch as the ability to cut and paste pictures, drag and\ndrop email attachments, and driver-less printing make it\neasy to work in a virtual machine.\n\nSnapshots and Clones: The Ultimate Time Saver\nSnapshots preserve the state of a virtual machine so you\ncan return to it at any time. Snapshots are useful when you\nneed to revert your virtual machine to a prior, stable\nsystem state. Workstation makes it easy to find and revert\nto a previously saved snapshot.\n\nInstalling operating systems and applications can be time\nconsuming. With clones, you can make many copies of a\nvirtual machine from the baseline installation and\nconfiguration. This makes it fast and simple to maintain\nstandardized computing environments for employees and\nstudents, or to create a baseline configuration for\ntesting.\n\nRun Multi-tiered Applications on a Single PC\nManage multiple, network-connected virtual machines with\nTeams. Teams make it easy to start and run complex multi-\ntier enterprise applications on a single PC with just a\nclick of the mouse.\n\nRewind and Replay Until You Find the Bug\nDiagnose non-deterministic bugs with the Replay Debugging\ntechnology integrated into Visual Studio and Eclipse. Test\nyour applications in a virtual machine while recording and\nthen let the developer step through the recording with a\ndebugger attached. Never again will there be a non-\nreproducible bug.\n\nINSTALL NOTES:\n\nUse the included keymaker to register ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29672e654d8a3bf0af87bd00ca99a30f44401dfa","amp;dn":"VMware.Workstation.v7.1.2.301548.Incl.Keymaker-EMBRACE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29672e654d8a3bf0af87bd00ca99a30f44401dfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,103,46,101,77,138,59,240,175,135,189,0,202,153,163,15,68,64,29,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
