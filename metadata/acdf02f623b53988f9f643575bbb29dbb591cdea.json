Jason has a friction with the handicapped owner Malek and the man in a wheelchair offers an ancient board game called Mamba from the Spanish Inquisition period for free to excuse his behavior. Meanwhile, Detective Izar is investigating the death of a man that was skinned alive. When a heavy rain falls during a party on the beach, Jason joins Tomas, Lisa, his new acquaintance Erica Vargas, Pablo, Miguel and Elena to play the game. Erica reads the rules and explains that the winner would have his wish granted while the losers would be cursed to die the way described in the cards. Pablo is the first to lose and borrows Tomas' car to buy some beers. Miguel, Lisa, Elena and Tomas also lose, but the players stop the game when Detective Eric arrives and informs that Pablo has just died. When Miguel, Lisa and Elena also die, Jason researches the Mamba in the Internet and finds that the pieces and board had been made of skin and bones of the witch Mamba Masamba and the cards had been written with her blood and tears. Jason decides to finish the game with Erica to undo the curse. \n\nCats :\nEliza Dushku\t ... \tErica\nMike Vogel\t... \tJason\nJose Casasus\t... \tNovio\nLilliam Kouri\t... \tMalek's Wife\nBoris Martinez\t... \tPablo\nAlex O'Dogherty\t... \tMalek\nAnder Pardo\t... \tMiguel\nGary Piquer\t... \tDetective Izar\nEthan Rains\t... \tTomas (as Iman Nazemzadeh)\nNaike Rivelli\t... \tElena\nLindsay Caroline Robba\t... \tLisa\nMartxelo Rubio\t... \tPolice Officer\nEnrique Zaldua\t... \tDetective / Police Officer\n\nData Technical :\n!!!
