This documentary was directed by Ray MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ller and is regarded by historians as the greatest propaganda film of all time.\n\nThe United States release of this film, in 1993, coincided with the publication of Riefenstahl's autobiography (Leni Riefenstahl: A Memoir, (New York, 1993)), as well as with her ninetieth birthday. The two releases are not unrelated. The Wonderful, Horrible life of Leni Riefenstahl was born from an idea of Riefenstahl herself, who, motivated by her old age and already working on her memoirs, decided to commission a documentary about her life. Concerned about being associated with the 'Nazi director', eighteen filmmakers declined the project, before MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ller agreed to portray Riefenstahl in what ended up being a three-hour long documentary (three times its contract length).\n\nThe length of the film is therefore the result of a decision by the director: MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ller justifies it as an attempt to give a fair representation of Riefenstahl's life, which cannot be reduced to the 8 years she worked for the regime, but presents much more interesting stories and facts that are relevant to understand her personality. Showing more historical material about her life, according to MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ller, also helps to compensate the strong image of herself that Riefenstahl tries to impose throughout the movie, giving the viewer a better chance to draw his own conclusions.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da10db292f14a131d01d52b25e4a3b41fc45c0ab","amp;dn":"Leni+Riefenstahl+Biopic+Docu.+%28Nazi+Filmmaker+-+Triumph+of+the+W","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da10db292f14a131d01d52b25e4a3b41fc45c0ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,16,219,41,47,20,161,49,208,29,82,178,94,74,59,65,252,69,192,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
