The Bible teaches that in latter days there will be a mass defection from the faith. There are signs already around us that this defection may have begun. Will modern-day Christians remain faithful under severe persecution as have past generations of church saints? As we search for solutions to the problems that concern us all - escalating crime, economic instability, and political unrest - many are drawn to the answers offered by secular humanism. Are we being lulled into a sense of false hope that man, not God, can save the world? 200 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e5d822aae94ff6541fdbbac44b0d69bc1dd8e8b","amp;dn":"Woods-Unlocking+the+Door-Key+to+Biblical+Prophecy%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e5d822aae94ff6541fdbbac44b0d69bc1dd8e8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,93,130,42,174,148,255,101,65,253,187,172,68,176,214,155,193,221,142,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
