Live from the National Auditorium, Mexico. This concert from August 8 was broadcast on national tv. Meat performed songs from his &quot;I couldn't have said it better&quot; album combined with some of his greatest hits.\nFor me the concert feels 'weird'.

None the less a very nice show.\n\nPAL DVD\nRun time: 78 mins.\nChapters: Yes, each song\nCover: Created and included by me\n\nSetlist:\n01 Do It\n02 Life is a Lemon\n03 Tear me Down\n04 Testify\n05 Anything For Love\n06 Couldn't Have Said it Better\n07 Paradise by the Dashboard Light\n08 Bat out of Hell\n\nCover (I changed my original cover):\n\nScreens:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f8227698987d17301fe41bca56294c9fddf1bc9","amp;dn":"Meat+Loaf+kive+in+Mexico+2003+dvd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f8227698987d17301fe41bca56294c9fddf1bc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,130,39,105,137,135,209,115,1,254,65,188,165,98,148,201,253,223,27,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
