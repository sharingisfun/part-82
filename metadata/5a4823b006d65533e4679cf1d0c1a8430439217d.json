He plans to torment \n   Mike Nelson and the robots by sending them a real stinker of a\n   film to watch called, &quot;This Island Earth.&quot; He is convinced that\n   this movie will drive them insane. And since the guys cannot\n   control when the movie begins or ends, they are forced to witness\n   the true horror that is this awful movie that has a lobster creature\n   dressed in slacks. But will this be the ultimate cheese that breaks\n   the boys' spirits? It's up to one test subject's quick wit, sharp\n   sense of humor, and utter intolerance for cinematic garbage to foil \n   the plans of the scientist and to save the Earth.\n                   \n                        \n         \n          \n                         Big up all scene massive! \n       \n        \n\n                                                                 \n                            GROUP INFORMATION\n                            \n                  9 Years of the Force and still going strong\n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro/asia sites\n           * Fios/Cable BluRay rippers or TV cappers\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;783e170a1b1d38100d0b10561911&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a4823b006d65533e4679cf1d0c1a8430439217d","amp;dn":"Mystery.Science.Theater.3000.The.Movie.1996.720p.HDTV.x264-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a4823b006d65533e4679cf1d0c1a8430439217d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,72,35,176,6,214,85,51,228,103,156,241,208,193,168,67,4,57,33,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
