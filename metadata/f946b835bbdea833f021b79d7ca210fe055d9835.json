From the beginning the band is characterized as a blues band faithfully devoted to the Chicago Style. For the first year the activity is almost exclusively live, with concerts throughout Italy. The debut release was Chicago Bound in 1990, followed by a live album.\n\n\n\n\nQuote:\n[4:38] 1. Greenwood, Mississippi\n[6:22] 2. Ride On, Blue Train\n[3:51] 3. Another Story\n[4:57] 4.
