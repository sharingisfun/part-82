Bush Catherine Austin Fitts blows the whistle on how the financial terrorists have deliberately imploded the US economy and transferred gargantuan amounts of wealth offshore as a means of sacrificing the American middle class. Fitts documents how trillions of dollars went missing from government coffers in the 90's and how she was personally targeted for exposing the fraud.\n\nFitts explains how every dollar of debt issued to service every war, building project, and government program since the American Revolution up to around 2 years ago - around $12 trillion - has been doubled again in just the last 18 months alone with the bank bailouts. &quot;We're literally witnessing the leveraged buyout of a country and that's why I call it a financial coup d'ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tat, and that's what the bailout is for,&quot; states Fitts.\n\nMassive amounts of financial capital have been sucked out the United States and moved abroad, explains Fitts, ensuring that corporations have become more powerful than governments, changing the very structure of governance on the planet and ensuring we are ruled by private corporations. Pension and social security funds have also been stolen and moved offshore, leading to the end of fiscal responsibility and sovereignty as we know it.\n\nFitts explained how when she was in government she tried to encourage the creation of small businesses, new jobs and new skills to compete in a globalized world otherwise the American middle class was toast, only to be forced out by the feds using dirty tricks. The elite instead wanted Americans to take on more credit card, mortgage and auto debt that corporations and insurers knew they couldn't afford, while quietly moving their jobs abroad in the meantime.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd2d9f3e86255f8c1b42725a3b9aa235e475ca09","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones%5C%27+interview+with+Catherine+Austin+Fitts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd2d9f3e86255f8c1b42725a3b9aa235e475ca09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,45,159,62,134,37,95,140,27,66,114,90,59,154,162,53,228,117,202,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
