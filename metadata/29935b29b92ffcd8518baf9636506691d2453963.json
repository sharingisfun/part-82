At the heart of the subdivision, its own fleet of soccer fields, manicured and gleaming - a game in play, a swarm of 12-year-olds running from end to end, moms and dads in that &quot;off-duty Hollywood&quot; look. At the foot of the subdivision: The desert to one side, long and dry, and endless-looking. To the other side, a span of high-desert foothills, rolling upward into the greener, higher mountains. It is here that two sets of kids - neighbors in both landscape and loss - will wake one morning to find that their paths begin to resemble that of a character in their favorite mythological book series. What they don't yet know is that an invisible darkness following them is what they make it out to be - themselves, their fears about their parents, the frequency of change in their lives, and the instability of a world lived on the mountain's edge.\n\nVideo\n\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 24mn\nBit rate : 1 041 Kbps\nWidth : 656 pixels\nHeight : 368 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nResolution : 8 bits\nColorimetry : 4:2:0\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.180\n\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 24mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 89.4 Kbps\nNominal bit rate : 112 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\n\nIMDB &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104779/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104779/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29935b29b92ffcd8518baf9636506691d2453963","amp;dn":"The+Five+%282010%29DvdRip+%5BXvid%5D+%7B1337x%7D-X.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29935b29b92ffcd8518baf9636506691d2453963","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,147,91,41,185,47,252,216,81,139,175,150,54,80,102,145,210,69,57,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
