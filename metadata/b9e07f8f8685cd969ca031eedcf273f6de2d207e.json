The 1st hour is live; the rest is a repeat.\n\nThe Infowars web site describes the show this way:\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Alex talks with former professional wrestler, soldier, and Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura about a brazen attempt by the government and the U.S. military to prevent him from filming in Washington D.C. and elsewhere for his popular TruTV television show, Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura. The premiere episode of the show was watched by 1.6 million viewers, TruTV's biggest audience for a new series launch. Ventura is the author of American Conspiracies: Lies, Lies, and More Dirty Lies that the Government Tells Us, available at Alex Jones' Infowars store. The book reached #6 on the New York Times best-seller list. Jesse also wrote Don't Start The Revolution Without Me!\n\n----------\n\nThe Ventura interview is in the 1st half of hour 1 and the rest of that hour is live.\n\nThe rest of the broadcast, however, is previously aired material from the July 14th show [the first 3 hours], featuring Richard Reeves, the host of &quot;Frontline Texas,&quot; and Larry Pratt, the executive director of Gun Owners of America.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_torrents_info_PLEASE-READ.txt\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
