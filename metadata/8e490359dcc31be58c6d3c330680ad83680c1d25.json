Thousands of bodies still lay under rubble. We begin todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s show in Port-Au-Prince outside what remains of the Montana Hotel where some 200 people died in the earthquake. We speak to Patrick Elie, a longtime Haitian democracy activist and HaitiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former Secretary of State for Public Security.\n&quot;We are a people who can fend for ourselves,&quot; Elie said. &quot;We have a vision of where we want to go so we do need friends but we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need people to think for us or to pity us and that is probably this attitude that is playing a part in the aid not being forthcoming.&quot;\n\n\n- Beverly Bell: There is No Plan For Permanently Housing the 1.9 Million Haitians Who Lost Their Homes in the Quake\n\n&quot;People are living in ravines, they are living on sidewalks, jammed up against other houses,&quot; says Beverly Bell, of the group Other Worlds. &quot;They are creating structures out of any temporary material they can find, a lot of them no more than four sticks and bed sheets.&quot; Bell also talks about how the international reconstruction plan for Haiti revolves around the creation of four new free enterprise zones which will expand the number of sweatshop factories in Haiti.\n\n\n- Displaced Haitians: &quot;We CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Continue In This Situation Anymore&quot;\n\nWe visited Camp Corail, one of the hundreds of camps for displaced people in Haiti. We spoke to two displaced Haitians Romain Arius and Fenel Domercant. They talked about how little aid has trickled down to the 1300 families in the camp. They were told they would only be in the camp for there months, but long after the deadline they continue to wait for permanent housing.
