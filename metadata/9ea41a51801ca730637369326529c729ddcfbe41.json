In his ruling, U.S. District Court Chief Judge Vaughn Walker wrote, &quot;Proposition 8 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license.

She's the 21 year-old American art student who lost her eye in May after being shot in the face by an Israeli tear gas canister at a protest against Israel's attack on the Gaza flotilla that left nine people dead. &quot;I'm not ashamed of the fact that I lost my eye. I'm proud of who I am. I believed in the cause and that's why I came to that demonstration on that day,&quot; Henochowicz says. &quot;I'm not going to be the same person that I was before this happened.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ea41a51801ca730637369326529c729ddcfbe41","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+05+aug+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ea41a51801ca730637369326529c729ddcfbe41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,164,26,81,128,28,167,48,99,115,105,50,101,41,199,41,221,207,190,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
