Frankie is so far the least successful salesperson at the local car dealership, a job she explains she took only after the dentist office she worked in closed down.\nAxl, the oldest, is her rebellious teenage son and was conceived with Guns N' Roses playing a significant role. He usually appears at home wearing only boxer shorts and regards any task or chore asked of him to be an enormous imposition. A handsome and confident teen, he is a school star athlete but struggles academically. Sue, the middle child and only daughter, wears braces, part of the reason for her almost neurotic self-consciousness. She attempts to cure this by frequently trying to join school organizations, but consistently fails. Because of this she has developed amazing resilience. Brick, the youngest child, is a very bright but socially awkward seven-year-old, who was given a &quot;cool name&quot; in the vain hope that he would develop into an equally cool kid.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/img687/8761/401hm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/img687/8761/401hm.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Card :.\n\nGenre: Comedy\nCreated by: Eileen Heisler, DeAnn Heline\nStarring: Patricia Heaton, Neil Flynn, Charlie McDermott, Eden Sher, Atticus Shaffer, Brian Doyle-Murray, Chris Kattan\nNarrated by: Patricia Heaton\nComposer: Joey Newman\nCountry of origin: United States\nLanguage: English\nExecutive producers: DeAnn Heline, Eileen Heisler\nRunning time: approx. 20-22 minutes\nProduction companys: Blackie and Blondie Productions, Warner Bros.
