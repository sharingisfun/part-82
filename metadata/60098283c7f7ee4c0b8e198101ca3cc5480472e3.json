In it you will find a Prophecy called the 70 weeks of Daniel. The 70th week is the most relevant to us today. It describes the Last 7 years before the return Jesus Christ. We may are may not have started that period already. My friend Jack D Hook has a time schedule for that return and I show below. The only problem is the time line runs in reverse so we do not know when it starts. \n\n[size=22]\nWhen the Sons of God,(Fallen Angels)saw the Daughters of Man and saw that they were &quot;fair&quot; and took them as the pleased creating a &quot;Hybrid Race&quot; referred to as the Nephilim.\n\nThe Return of The Nephilim is Prophesied. As in the Days of Noah so shall there be in the days of the return of Christ. In The Days of Noah there were Nephilim in The Land. The offspring of the Blending of The Species of Woman and The Fallen Angels are the Nephilim. Are they alive today? Yes. That most famous bloodline of Aristocracy, The Blue Bloods, The Reptilians, The Windsors, Rothschilds, Bushes, Rockefeller's, Warburgs etc. It is The Satanic Blood Line of Lucifer. If they are the Bloodline of Lucifer, did Jesus Die on the Cross for them? NO, I think naught. That is my personal opinion and not a frequently thought of one. This would explain their lack of care for Humanity the Elite. (The Blood Line of Adam). \n\nDid you know that if the richest 200 families in the World would give just 4% of their wealth to Humanity we could House, cloth and feed every person on the Planet. Quite a bunch Reptiles. Thats why they all hide under rocks and caves in The Last Days rather face the WRATH of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ when he returns to clean house. peace\n\n\n\nDAYS OF DANIEL'S 70TH WEEK  By Jack D Hook\n1st Day\n\nPeace covenant between Israel and enemies arranged by America, Daniel 9:27, Revelation 6:2, 8:1. Construction of temple begins. Days of religious, political deception will be shortened when Russia invades within 1,230 days, Matthew 24:22. Rapture is history, body of Christ in Heaven, Revelation 4. Jesus comes in 2,520 days.\n\n220th Day\n\nTemple construction allows for sacrifices and oblations to begin. Taken away in 1,010 days by Russian-Syrian leader. Jesus comes in 2,300 days. Temple site then cleansed, Daniel 8:13-14.\n\n869th Day\n\nTwo witnesses begin 1,260 day ministry, Revelation 11:3. They will be warning the Jews of the imminent Russian-Syrian invasion. Their ministry will be during both halves of the 70th Week because of Revelation 11:6, which shows God's judgement of water to blood, which occurs in last half; and Revelation 11:10, which shows world rejoicing at the death of two witnesses. If they ministered only in the last half, the world would be terrified and mourning at sight of returning Lord, not rejoicing. If they minister only first half, how can waters turn to blood, which is God's wrath? Witnesses preach against beast and harlot church and for the coming of Jesus in power and glory. Jesus comes in 1,651 days.\n\nDays of religious, political deception (world peace) will be shortened or elect would be deceived. Days shortened by Russian confederacy invading the Middle East sometime between the 869th and 1,230th day, Ezekiel 38, Daniel 11. World War III erupts, probably nuclear and conventional. Takes peace from earth, Revelation 6:4.\n\n1,230th Day\n\nRussian-Syrian leader takes away sacrifices of Jews, Daniel 8:11, 11:31, 12:11. Within 30 days the first of seven trumpet judgements begin as God destroys Russian-Syrian armies, Ezekiel 38:22, Revelation 8:7. Days of war and sudden destruction shortened or all flesh perish, (nuclear war) Matthew 24:22. Jesus comes in 1,290 days, Daniel 12:11)\n\n1,260th Day\n\nMidweek. Antichrist from America has been resurrected from the dead. Armies of America and Western Europe have invaded and now occupy Israel and the Middle East. Antichrist causes sacrifices to cease. Makes temple desolate by saying he is God, Daniel 9:27, 12:11. Antichrist or beast given power over all nations, and persecutes the saints, Revelation 13:7. Jesus comes in 1,260 days.\n\nWrath of God meets wrath of Satan for 1,260 days. Days of Great Tribulation and days of Jacob's Trouble. Great days of real revival through two witnesses and 144,000 Jewish evangelists, Revelation 7. Trumpet and then bowl judgements poured out by the angels of God. Harlot church hated by antichrist and burned.\n\n1979th Day\n\n5th trumpet sounds. 5 months (150 days) demon locusts torment unsaved, Revelation 9:5. First 4 trumpet judgements covered approximately 719 days. Jesus comes in 541 days.\n\n2129th Day\n\n6th trumpet sounds for 3 1/2 days. Two witnesses complete 1,260-day ministry. Killed by antichrist from America. Bodies left in streets of Jerusalem for 3 1/2 days, Revelation 11:8, 11. Antichrist will order their bodies to be untouched as a mockery to the prophecy of their resurrection. Their death and display of bodies angers God. Judgements will intensify. Last hour, day, month, year (391 days) of bowl judgements result of God's anger. Fullness of God's wrath, Revelation 9:15, 10:7, 15:7. Jesus comes in 391 days.\n\n2132 1/2 Day\n\nTwo witnesses rise from the dead, ascend to Heaven before multitudes, probably watching on satellite television, Revelation 11:11-12, 15. 7th trumpet sounds announcing the beginning of the 7 bowl judgements. Last 387 1/2 days begin.\n\n2,520th Day\n\nFire from Heaven has destroyed America or Babylon the Great, Revelation 18. Jesus Christ appears in the skies for all eyes to see Him. Antichrist and false prophet are cast in to Lake of Fire, Revelation 19:20. Jesus first destroys all world's armies at Armageddon, who have been gathered by beast and false prophet to fight against Him, thinking He is an alien invading force, Revelation 1:7, 19:11-21. Satan is cast into the bottomless pit for 1,000 years, Revelation 20:1-3. All saints who were in Heaven come with Jesus. Judgement of surviving people of the nations begins. Temple cleansed of antichrist. 2,300 days completed, Daniel 8:13-14. 1,000-year reign of Jesus Christ begins. Praise God!\n[/size]\n\nI am using a SEED BOX that uploads at rates of 2mb/s per leecher.
