It is also the title of a song from the album.\nSide One was given over to (then) fledgling pop band The Sweet and features the A &amp; B-sides of what were three commercially unsuccessful singles (on Parlophone Records) before the band finally found fame with &quot;Funny Funny&quot; released by RCA Records. Despite the cover shot of The Sweet featuring Andy Scott, he was not actually a band member until &quot;Funny Funny&quot; and does not feature on any of these recordings. The band's guitarist then was Mick Stewart (who replaced Frank Torpey) and wrote two of the featured B-sides on this compilation.\n\nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks........!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8991b6eb8c8e6d5e51a54ae547acaff1ab296d70","amp;dn":"The+Pipkins-Gimme+Dat+Ding-1970","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8991b6eb8c8e6d5e51a54ae547acaff1ab296d70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,145,182,235,140,142,109,94,81,165,74,229,71,172,175,241,171,41,109,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
