Windia is a normal 13 year old girl who warped into Gilbaland, a fairytale place that was not on the map. The beautiful and peaceful kingdom, however, was constantly at war with monsters and demons. Since Windia and three other girls have been taken in by an elderly man who sold his services to the king for a living, to return the favour, the girls, using their newly acquired powers, flew into the sky to face off with the demons.\n\nCute characters, beautiful graphics and delicately drawn backgrounds, the game was a huge hit when it came out in the arcades. Take your arcade game home, published for Xbox360, the game retains its visuals excitement and gives you the comfort, or relief of playing the game in your own living room.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4eddc92ad36d6760825c19a12f4eb17b737f9bd1","amp;dn":"Death+Smiles+%5BEnglish%5D%5BXBOX360%5D%5BUSA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4eddc92ad36d6760825c19a12f4eb17b737f9bd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,221,201,42,211,109,103,96,130,92,25,161,47,78,177,123,115,127,155,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
