They shared one common goal - a forward-looking desire to transcend Germany's gruesome past - but that didn't stop the music press in war-obsessed Britain from calling them Krautrock.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nf10k&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nf10k&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSub type: XVID\nDimensions: 608x336\nFPS: 25,00\nChannels: 2 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e5cb7c40861a88496a6a5f9872c025d10075817","amp;dn":"Krautrock%3A+The+Rebirth+of+Germany+%282009%29+%5BPDTV.XviD%5D+%5BENG%5D+Docum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e5cb7c40861a88496a6a5f9872c025d10075817","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,92,183,196,8,97,168,132,150,166,165,249,135,44,2,93,16,7,88,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
