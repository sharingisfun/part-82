Gary Houseman (Scott) is an overenthusiastic high school janitor who steps-up to lead the school's loser tennis team to the state finals when the acting coach drops dead. The brash and often insulting new coach is intent on inspiring these underdogs not only to win, but also to stand-up for themselves. Although his coaching tactics may be unorthodox, including motivating his star player with a pre-game stripper, his heart is in the right place. Besides, sometimes it takes big balls to play hard-ball.\n\nCast:\nRandy Quaid ... Coach Lew Tuttle\nBryan Aguinaga ... Mourner\nMax Alpar ... Southpoint teammate\nBrent Anderson ...
