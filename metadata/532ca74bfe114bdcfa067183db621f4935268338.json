Hopefully\nthere will be a few people here that like it.\n\nThis is a 2-Disc Custom Compilation of .hack//ROOTS that I put together\nusing ConvertXtoDVD.\n\nI pushed this authoring program to its limits to include menu features\nsuch as custom fonts and full-length background music (from the OST) as\nwell as dual style english subtitles.\n\nEnglish is the default language dub but japanese is included as well.\nSubtitles are in english.\n\nThe menus consist of a Title Menu, Root Menu, Chapter Menu, and Settings\nMenu - each menu has its own background music track from the OST.\n\nThe chapters are set up so that you can easily skip the 1:30 opening of\neach episode.\n\nThe picture quality is the best that I could possibly get it - I took the\nhighest quality episode rips that I could find on the internet, and to be\nhonest they look (and sound) REALLY awesome. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“m amazed how much difference\nde-interlacing makes with anime. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ll find that these episodes look way\nbetter than a regular interlaced anime DVD.\n\n(BTW I also made a similar compilation of Xenosaga: The Animation, so if\nanyone wants it, please post here and let me know. And yes, I plan on\nmaking one for SIGN as well... Some day... These things take FOREVER!)\n\nHere are screen shots of the DVD menus:\nDISC 1 - http://a.imageshack.us/img245/961/vlcsnap2010090912h08m18.png\n\nDISC 2 - http://a.imageshack.us/img259/1679/vlcsnap2010090912h18m48.png","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:532ca74bfe114bdcfa067183db621f4935268338","amp;dn":".hack%2F%2FROOTS+2-Disc+DVD9+Custom+Compilation+%5BNTSC-U%5D+%5BDUAL-AUDIO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"532ca74bfe114bdcfa067183db621f4935268338","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,44,167,75,254,17,75,220,250,6,113,131,219,98,31,73,53,38,131,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
