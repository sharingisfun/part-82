I installed it using this site \n\nINSTALL: http://androidoperatingsystem.net/2010/07/30/how-to-manually-install-android-2-2-on-the-htc-evo-4g/\n\nREVIEWS: http://www.wirelessandmobilenews.com/2010/07/android-froyo-news-htc-evo-4g-slated-for-updateupgrade-to-android-22-82.html\n\nThis worked for me i am not sure if it will work for all phones as the rumor flying around the internet states OFFICIAL BUT NOT FINAL. \n\na few new features\n* flash light with 3 levels\n* pin password protection\n* car dock settings\n* camera settings rotate with phone\n* landscape mode not limited to left tilt\n* ability to use the light with the camcorder\n* FM radio widget\n* News and weather widget\n* App sharing\n* ability to store and run apps on SD card\n\nI am sure there is more this is just a quick list of what i found, any comments of what i missed would be appreciated. Also let me know what you think.\n\nThings i have noticed are the wifi connection is a lot better and the phone runs a lot faster.
