We have updated to Gnome 2.30. Now you can install GhostBSD by terminal commands and a list with pc-sysinstall. The partitions supported to install GhostBSD are UFS, UFS+S (plus soft updates7), UFS+J (plus journaling8), ZFS, and SWAP. A 'how to install' is on the desktop. With GhostBSD in your hard drive you have Linux-f10 compatibility that means you can install Linux apps and Linux flash. Cups ready to use. Compiz installed and ready to use. This is the first installable version. Not so user friendly. But I have promised something. The last month all was going wrong and I decide to go with pc-sysinstall. Now for the next 6 mount I will work on a graphic installer for 2.0. GhostBSD amd64 is coming the next week.&quot; \n\nmd5sum : 9d1e8ce197864c90f38e6e82ab26a638  GhostBSD-1.5-x86.iso\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ghostbsd.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ghostbsd.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5dc87778fb71c27baf76fdb7ba1e071d0438fbf","amp;dn":"GhostBSD-1.5-x86.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5dc87778fb71c27baf76fdb7ba1e071d0438fbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,220,135,119,143,183,28,39,186,247,111,219,123,161,224,113,208,67,143,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
