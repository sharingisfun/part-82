It was released on September 13, 2010 in the UK and September 14 in the USA.\n\nThe first single released from the album was &quot;Angel Dance&quot;.\n\nThe Band of Joy are a rock band from Birmingham, England. Various lineups of the group performed from 1965 to 1968 and from 1977 to 1983. Robert Plant revived the band's name in 2010 for a concert tour of the United States and Europe.\n\nThe band is notable for including two musicians, Robert Plant and John Bonham, who went on to join Led Zeppelin; and, to a lesser degree, because the band's one-time roadie was Noddy Holder, who later was in the band Slade.\n\nThe Band Of Joy was originally formed in 1966 in West Bromwich, near Birmingham, England by Chris Brown (keyboards), Vernon Pereira (guitar), and singer Robert Plant. Conflicts with the band's management led to Plant leaving the group after a few months. He quickly tried to form his own Band of Joy, but it soon folded. A third incarnation of the band, including Plant's childhood friend John Bonham, lasted from 1967 to mid-1968. Their brand of soul and blues was popular with Birmingham mods. This lineup recorded a number of demo recordings in early 1968, but broke up in May 1968 when a recording contract failed to materialise.\n\nAlbeit briefly, lead guitar duties were taken by Dave Pegg, who later played the bass guitar with Fairport Convention. Pegg rehearsed with Band of Joy but did not tour with them.\n\nFor a 1968 tour of Scotland, Plant and Bonham co-opted bassist John Hill (ex-Uncle Joseph) and guitarist Mick Strode to fill out a temporary lineup.\n\nIn 1977 Gammond and Paul Lockey revived the Band of Joy, rounding out the lineup with John Pasternak, Peter Robinson, and keyboardist Michael Chetwood. Gammond, Lockey, Pasternak and Robinson had previously played in Bronco. They invited Plant and Bonham to contribute to their 1978 self-titled album, but nothing came of it. The group released a second album in 1983 before breaking up.\n\nIn 2010 it was announced that Plant would form a new band and tour as Robert Plant &amp; the Band of Joy.\n\nRobert Anthony Plant, CBE (born 20 August 1948), is an English rock singer and songwriter, best known as the lead vocalist and lyricist of the rock band Led Zeppelin. He has also had a successful solo career. In 2007, Plant released Raising Sand, an album produced by T-Bone Burnett with American bluegrass soprano Alison Krauss, which won the 2009 Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6141dde767718b1b9740059d2a7fcce213cf44e","amp;dn":"Robert+Plant+-+Angel+Dance+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6141dde767718b1b9740059d2a7fcce213cf44e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,20,29,222,118,119,24,177,185,116,0,89,210,167,252,206,33,60,244,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
