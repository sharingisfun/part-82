This remains one of the most enigmatic questions of the last century. Acclaimed historian Laurence Rees examines what led a cultured nation at the heart of Europe to commit the atrocities it did. In so doing, he exposes popular myths and encourages understanding of the real forces that led to one of the darkest chapters in modern history. Was it simply the hypnotic power of Hitler's rhetoric? Did the Gestapo really impose themselves by terror on an unwilling population? Through interviews with witnesses and perpetrators, along with archive film and records, this six-part series unveils a more chilling reality.\n\nQuality VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo: DVDrip (RMVB)\nYear: 1997 (EUA)\nTime: 48 Min Cada CapÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­tulo\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Codec: Real Player\nResolution: 512x384\nScreen Format: Full screen(4x3)\nAudio: English\nAtached Subtitle Portuguese-BR'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab2d3cd1a18517b663c7a22a89029207b8d6f57","amp;dn":"The+Nazis%3A+A+Warning+From+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab2d3cd1a18517b663c7a22a89029207b8d6f57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,178,211,205,26,24,81,123,102,60,122,34,168,144,41,32,123,141,111,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
