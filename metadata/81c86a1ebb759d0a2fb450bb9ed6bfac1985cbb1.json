Armed with Wainwright's famous Pictorial Guides, Julia is setting out on some of the biggest and most popular fell walks in the country. Through sunshine and rain, Julia explores the stunning landscape that inspired the late Alfred Wainwright to produce his beautifully crafted guide books.\n\nNobody can call themselves a true fellwalker until England's most popular mountain has been conquered. Julia Bradbury sets off to reach the summit of Helvellyn via the Lake District's most talked-about ridge - Striding Edge. And just like legendary fell walker Alfred Wainwright, Julia discovers herself reaching the Edge for the very first time, just as the cloud and the rain descend.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81c86a1ebb759d0a2fb450bb9ed6bfac1985cbb1","amp;dn":"Wainwright+Walks+-+S02E01+-+Helvellyn.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81c86a1ebb759d0a2fb450bb9ed6bfac1985cbb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,200,106,30,187,117,157,10,47,180,80,187,158,214,191,172,25,133,203,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
