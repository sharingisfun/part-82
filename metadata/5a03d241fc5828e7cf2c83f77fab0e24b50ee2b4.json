This is the divine Word of God.\n\nAbout 16 Billion years there was nothing. Then nothing exploded creating The Universe that we know of today. The Earth was void and lifeless. Then a Miracle. A single cell was accidently created by water sloshing on Rocks. Over Billions and Billions of Years this single cell began mutating until it mutated into a fish, then it grew legs and &quot;walked OUT of the Ocean&quot;. While all this was happening this single cell mutated into everything else that we know and see.  HA HA HA HA HA HA HA \n\nThat above statement is pure Science Fiction. This what is taught in our Worldly Schools. This is what the Earth Dwellers Teach. Human Life has NO MEANING, Do as Thou Wilt. There is no Price to pay for sin. There are no Morals except what you create. Life has no meaning is what Darwin and his brainless Professors teach. While the Life of a Professor that teaches this bunk has no meaning, The life of a believer does. We were created by The Creator for a specific purpose that we can not know to much about until we get there, unless you follow the Blue Print for Eternity you will wish you were that single cell, that Darwin talks about.\n\nThis Genesis Lecture is some of Missler's finest work. All you have to do is listen for the truth from Chuck as he proves the TRUTH about The Creation and The Bible with Science and Math.\n\nPraise Jesus, Amen\n\n\n\n\n\ntype POtHS in your search window for more info.\n\n\n\nRAPtURE  (My transportation outta here.)\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross, paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him... \n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.   \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.    \n\nGet info on the Take Over by The New World Order Below \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&lt;/a&gt; \nListen to Alex Jones  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bibledatabase.com/html_bibles.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bibledatabase.com/html_bibles.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://hickoryhammockbaptist.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://hickoryhammockbaptist.org&lt;/a&gt;\n \nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father.
