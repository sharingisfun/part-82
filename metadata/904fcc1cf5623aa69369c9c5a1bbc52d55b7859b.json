Playing as a Geon cube, players frantically race against up to three other opponents to collect pellets and deposit them in the opponent's goal to score. At the same time players fight desperately to prevent their opponents from scoring by the tactical use of eight different powerballs including Rage which lays down a layer of spikes that can block an opponent or trap them, and Greed which sucks up pellets enabling the scoring of a fast goal. All of the powerballs significantly alters the ebb and flow of each game and allows each player to develop their own unique strategies in their quest to be the first to score five goals and win the game.    \n\n\nNOTE: To play this game you need a chipped or soft modded Wii.\n\nTo install &amp; play off disc:\n1.
