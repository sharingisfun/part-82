It sounds like she is smiling throughout, and her enthusiasm is catching.\n\nThe first of three original tracks, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Holding OnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ allows the music to flow freer than some of the traditional arrangements. Notes can be held for longer, different harmonies can come to the fore, and the spotlight can be shone on Hannah EdmondsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ captivating cello line, which can be overlooked in some of the more boisterous track. Offering a chance to catch your breath in a busy world, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Holding OnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ shows the wealth of talent contained within this single CD.\n\nThe first single to be taken from the album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Si tu dois partirÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is RuthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s take on Fairport Convention legendary cover of Bob DylanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve gotta go.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always a risky move to cover a classic, but Ruth absolutely nails it, making the 40 year old track completely her own.\n\nMaking the most of a band comprising of some of the biggest names in British Folk, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to beliefÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ allows them all a chance to truly let loose and have fun with the music. The resulting track feels ever so slightly mischievous and is, therefore, one of the catchiest on the album. Whilst the instrumentation is undeniably full and complex, it maintains a light and bright feel, which allows RuthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s equally light vocals to fly free. Put it on, turn it up and prepare to dance around the room like a loon.\n\nNonetheless, Ruth saves the best for last. Sung completely a capella, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Hold back the tideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is a stunning track which sends shivers down your spine. Vocal support comes in the form of Joe Heap and Bella Hardy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a combination which produces some incredibly engaging harmony loosely reminiscent of the barbershop groups in the 1940s\n\nOn her MySpace page, Ruth Notman refers to The Life of Lilly as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“musical journeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. So perhaps it is fitting that the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s final track is a plaintive lament, a woman asking her lover ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“JohnnyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ to hold back the tide to prevent him from leaving. But just as the tide does eventually turn, so must the album come to an end. As Ruth herself sings, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe big ships have gone home, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no more to tellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a070075ad1c820ec8d65bf0b1078b50ea2f6db3","amp;dn":"Ruth+Notman...The+Life+of+Lilly%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a070075ad1c820ec8d65bf0b1078b50ea2f6db3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,7,0,117,173,28,130,14,200,214,91,240,177,7,139,80,234,47,109,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
