Captain O'Hagan urges his men to limit their endless shenanigans and get some serious police work done to restore their image. However, the endless hazing of 'rookie' Rabbit (actually by far the best-behaved) and running gag practices seem in their genes. In Farva's case he can't help getting suspended within hours and 'exiled' to desk and menial duties. The accidental discovery of a corps and huge amounts of marijuana offer a last chance, but Grady is determined to put the feather on his cap, even if that takes playing dirty. Trooper Foster gets involved with young Spurbury cop Ursula, romantically and in the investigation, which turns up some surprises.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/media/rm4054490880/tt0247745&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/media/rm4054490880/tt0247745&lt;/a&gt; (--- Screen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:408fea98a684654500b7675933c91a3ff4059727","amp;dn":"Super.Troopers.Widescreen.DVDR.NTSC.ZeroUp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"408fea98a684654500b7675933c91a3ff4059727","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,143,234,152,166,132,101,69,0,183,103,89,51,201,26,63,244,5,151,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
