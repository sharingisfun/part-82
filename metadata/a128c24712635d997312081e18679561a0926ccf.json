First extract the 7z archive to desired directory on your hard drive (for\n   example, your desktop).\n \n2. Use a virtual CD/DVD emulator program such as Daemon Tools to mount the ISO\n   image as a virtual CD.\n\n3. Install the game from the virtual CD you just mounted.\n\n4. When the game is installed, install the patch to the directory where you just\n   installed the game.\n\n5. Now that you've done steps 1-4, just go ahead and launch the game from the start\n   menu.\n\nMaking your own maps:\n---------------------\nIf you feel like creating your own maps, just launch the Unreal Editor 2.0.
