When his parents demand he leave, he begins to spread rumors that his father is sexually abusing Freddy.  \n\n\nReview from IMDB - My friend came in saying to me: 'You have got to see this film.' Upon asking him why, he told me that it was one of the most hilarious films he had ever seen. I usually find this particular person's opinion correct, so I bought the DVD.\nI must say, I did find it very funny, but also very extreme. This film has very much been built up on it's controversy, like many other films. Some quotes include, 'purile and disgusting' 'highly offensive' and 'stupid, immoral and idiotic.' All of the above are true.\nBut it is also very, very funny.\nI had never heard of Tom Green before, so I didn't really know what to expect. I put on the DVD, and judging by the cover, the blurb and the beginning of the film, it seemed like a light hearted, stupid slapstick fare. I wish I had paid more attention to the rating.\nThe storyline is non - existent. Well, very little anyway. Gordy, a wannabe animator, tries to make a break for Hollywood, making just enough money as a cheese sandwich factory worker. But he fails miserably, and goes back to living at home with his parents.\nThat is all the 'storyline' I could decipher. What follows is a barrage of offensively brilliant comedy, including the infamous deer scene.\nFor 90% of the films running time, it doesn't really make sense. That is the one thing you must remember. But it is not supposed to. I think that it is not the deer scene that sets the tone, though. It's another.\nHere's the scene: Gordy and his friend, Darren are standing on a half - pipe built outside Gordy's home. Darren tries to do a bit of skating, and trips up and breaks his leg - bone poking out through the skin, blood everywhere, and Darren screaming. This really took me aback - I wasn't really expecting anything so disgusting. While I was laughing a retching at Tom Green's childish antics during this scene, I never really recovered from it.\nAlthough not all the humour is disgusting; some of it is just plain weird. For example, the sketch where Gordy hangs sausages from the ceiling and hooks them up to the piano strings, so that when he plays on the piano the sausages go up and down, made me crack a grin. He plays while randomly singing in an off - tone voice, 'Daddy, would you like some sausage? Daddy would you like some sausages?&quot; It made me smile just out of pure curiosity.\nAlso in the bizarre section of the humour of this movie is the 'Treasure' sequence, in which Gordy childishly pretends he is a deep sea diver in the shower, and pretends that soap on a rope is treasure. This had me a bit weirded out, to say the least.\nAnd last, but not least, is the 'Backwards Man' sequence. This is brilliant/stupid depending on who you talk to. In my opinion, this sequence is one of the films stand out moments.\nBut what I really think makes Freddy Got Fingered shine is the moments which parody the usual Hollywood schmaltz's. For example:\n'Oh Gordy,I don't care about jewels. All I really wanna do is.... suck your c***'\n'This has been a valuable life lesson. This trip hasn't been about spending about acting like a d***, shouting at the top of my voice like a hyperactive child or whacking off an elephant. This trip has been about the fact that one million dollars should be spent the right way. The American way. Blowing it all in one go on a load of s*** I will never need'\nSo sure, this movie ain't no masterpiece. But it is a damn fine comedy, one that made me laugh a lot, and a truly offensive one too.\nAnd you don't see that too often nowadays. \n\nVideo Specs: \nVideo #0          : AVC at 400 Kbps\nAspect            : 480 x 272 (1.765) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nPlease seed when finished downloading and leave a comment, request, etc. And above all ENJOY! \n\nIf you would like to live chat or instant message me, here is one of my many contacts -  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;53323d34363f3a3037363e3c3d656a133b3c273e323a3f7d303c7d2638&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;  \n\nIf anyone would like any tv show, movie, music video, or yes, even XXX, for PSP or any other handheld device for that matter.
