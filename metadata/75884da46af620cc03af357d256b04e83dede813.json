The history continues as she climbs 2,500ft to the summit of High Street, the most well-trodden high ground in the Lakes. This was where Roman legions crossed the fells 2,000 years ago, making, quite literally, a high street.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75884da46af620cc03af357d256b04e83dede813","amp;dn":"Wainwright+Walks+-+S02E05+-+High+Street.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75884da46af620cc03af357d256b04e83dede813","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,136,77,164,106,246,32,204,3,175,53,125,37,107,4,232,61,237,232,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
