At the heart of the subdivision, its own fleet of soccer fields, manicured and gleaming - a game in play, a swarm of 12 year olds running from end to end, moms and dads in that &quot;off-duty Hollywood&quot; look. At the foot of the subdivision: The desert to one side, long and dry, and endless-looking. To the other side, a span of high-desert foothills, rolling upward into the greener, higher mountains. It is here that two sets of kids neighbors in both landscape and loss will wake one morning to find that their paths begin to resemble that of a character in their favorite mythological book series. What they don't yet know is that an invisible darkness following them is what they make it out to be - themselves, their fears about their parents, the frequency of change in their lives, and the instability of a world lived on the mountain's edge.\n\nCats :\nMadisen Beaty\t ... \tAdilyne\nEmily Cho\t... \tRenee\nSam Gregory\t... \tDavid Gibson\nOmid Harrison\t... \tHexagon\nAllison Larned\t... \tMalia\nBen Larned\t... \tMarcus\nDan Lauria\t... \tMr. H\nRy Feder Pruett\t... \tJackson\nElizabeth Rainer\t... \tJulie Gibson\nElizabeth Rose\t... \tEmily Quarnberg\nJordan Shaffer\t... \tSoccer referee\nLindsay Shaffer\t... \tIce cream shop worker\nBrian Gregory Shea\t... \tPaul Quarnberg\n\nData Technical :\nAudio.....: English\nSubtitles.: None\nVideo.....: XviD 592x336 23.98fps [Stream 00]\nAudio.....: Dolby AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps [Stream 01]\n\nScreen :\n[img]http://img641.imageshack.us/img641/7518/thefive2010screen.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53fa60e65afdcd4e67f7e2d3754b49b138609064","amp;dn":"The+Five+%2A2010%2A+%5BDVDRip.XviD-miguel%5D+%5BENG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53fa60e65afdcd4e67f7e2d3754b49b138609064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,250,96,230,90,253,205,78,103,247,226,211,117,75,73,177,56,96,144,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
