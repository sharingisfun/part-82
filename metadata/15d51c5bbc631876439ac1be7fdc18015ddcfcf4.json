On one particular Saturday morning, he gets called in on his day off. Once there, he must deal with multiple problems. The shutters outside won't open. His ex-girlfriend, whom he is still in love with, is getting married. His girlfriend, who bugs him about starting college, has revealed certain, uh...stuff about her past. His boss hasn't come in to take his place. He has a hockey game at 2 o'clock. Another ex has died, and today's the last day he can go to her wake. He must deal with customers that aren't so intelligent. His friend, Randal, a clerk at the video store next door, is even less dedicated to his job than Dante, and is always bothering Dante's customers. And the biggest problem of them all: HE'S NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TODAY!! Can Dante manage it all?\n\nBrian O'Halloran   \t ...  \tDante\nJeff Anderson \t... \tRandal\nMarilyn Ghigliotti \t... \tVeronica\nLisa Spoonhauer \t... \tCaitlin\nJason Mewes \t... \tJay\nKevin Smith \t... \tSilent Bob\nScott Mosier \t... \tWillam the Idiot Manchild / Angry Hockey-Playing Customer / Angry Mourner\nScott Schiaffo \t... \tChewlies Rep\nAl Berkowitz \t... \tOld Man\nWalter Flanagan \t... \tWoolen Cap Smoker / Egg Man / Offended Customer / Cat-Admiring Bitter Customer (as Walt Flanagan)\nEd Hapstak \t... \tSanford / Angry Mourner\nLee Bendick \t... \t#812 Wynarski\nDavid Klein \t... \tHunting Cap Smoking Boy / Low I.Q.

Dante is ready to leave the horrors of minimum-wage New Jersey behind, but Randal - always the more hostile of the two - starts to become overwhelmed by his own rancor\n\nBrian O'Halloran   \t ...  \tDante\nJeff Anderson \t... \tRandal\nJason Mewes \t... \tJay\nKevin Smith \t... \tSilent Bob\nJake Richardson \t... \tTeen #1\nEthan Suplee \t... \tTeen #2\nRachel Larratt \t... \tCounter Girl with Ear Guy\nShannon Larratt \t... \tEar Guy\nJennifer Schwalbach Smith \t... \tEmma\nBen Affleck \t... \tGawking Guy\nSarah Ault \t... \tCatholic Schoolgirl\nLalida Sujjavasin \t... \tCatholic Schoolgirl\nTrevor Fehrman \t... \tElias\nGail Stanley \t... \tElias' Mom\nBruce Macintosh \t... \tElias' Dad \n\nI Do Not Deal With RAR's Or Fakes.
