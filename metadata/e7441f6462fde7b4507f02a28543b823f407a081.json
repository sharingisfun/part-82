The home page of the \noriginal lectures can be found at MIT OCW:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://ocw.mit.edu/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://ocw.mit.edu/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThese are the MP4 files available directly from ocw.mit.edu, I have tried all the available downloads and I believe these are the best. They\\\\\\'re a bit blockier than some, but have the best sound quality. I\\\\\\'m attempting to improve on xyz2007\\\\\\'s excellent torrent by adding the rest of the course materials and using different source files. This description shamelessly rips his off, but no need to reinvent the wheel :)\n\nNote: I have uploaded these before, but pulled down the torrent as I noticed several problems. This one is a big improvement :)\n\n\n\tCourse description\n\t-------------------\n\n8.01 is a first-semester freshman physics class in Newtonian Mechanics, Fluid \nMechanics, and Kinetic Gas Theory. In addition to the basic concepts of Newtonian\nMechanics, Fluid Mechanics, and Kinetic Gas Theory, a variety of interesting topics\nare covered in this course: Binary Stars, Neutron Stars, Black Holes, Resonance \nPhenomena, Musical Instruments, Stellar Collapse, Supernovae, Astronomical\nobservations from very high flying balloons (lecture 35), and you will be allowed\na peek into the intriguing Quantum World. \n\n\n\n\tHighlights of this Course\n\t-------------------------\n\nThis course features lecture notes, problem sets with solutions, exams with \nsolutions, links to related resources, and a complete set of videotaped lectures.\nThe 35 video lectures by Professor Lewin, were recorded on the MIT campus during \nthe Fall of 1999. Prof. Lewin is well-known at MIT and beyond for his dynamic and \nengaging lecture style. \n\n\n\n\tLicense\n\t-------\n\nThese lectures are generously put on-line by MIT, and are licensed under the\nCreative Commons License (BY-NC-SA) and so it is perfectly legal to share them.\nTherefore, please seed as long a possible, to ensure this amazing resource stays\navailable.\n\nFor more information on the Creative Commons license see:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7441f6462fde7b4507f02a28543b823f407a081","amp;dn":"MIT+Physics+8.01%3A+Classical+Mechanics+-+Lecture+Videos+and+Cours","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7441f6462fde7b4507f02a28543b823f407a081","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,68,31,100,98,253,231,180,80,127,2,162,133,67,184,35,244,7,160,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
