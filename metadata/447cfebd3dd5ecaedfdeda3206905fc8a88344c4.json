Ram and Rahim were two different characters \nplaying role of secret agents.\nIn most of the stories their job will be to save the world from a wicked scientist\nor an enemy of their nation. A typical story will feature their mission to bring \nback a stolen secret file from the villain's den, before it reaches the enemy nation.\nThe choice of character's name as Ram and Rahim was also contributing towards religious\nharmony among children. According to one volume namely Vatann ke Dushman Rahim is \nthe son of a Pakistani colonel who defected to India after he got disillusioned by \nfanaticism of Pakistani armed forces, especially an officer named Fanneh Khan. \nRam is the eldest son of a highly placed Indian Intelligence beaurecrat.\nRam is a Hindu name while Rahim is a Muslim name. Both will have tremendous friendship \nand both will work together to save the world.\nThey have a enemy named Dr. Fomanchu.\nIn later stories, Rahim loses his one hand and has to make do with a prosthetic arm \nthat has the same capabilities as a normal hand, but much stronger and faster.\nChildren used to wait for summer holidays in the late 80s and early 90s for special \neditions of Ram-Rahim's and Crookbond's comics during summer holidays.\n\nCOMICS LIST:\n\n081 Kankaba Ka Shaitan.cbr\t15.96 MB\n082 Jadugar Kobra.pdf\t6.53 MB\n083 Devta Ka Pyala.pdf\t24.85 MB\n084 Vinashdoot Karkarentan.pdf\t8.29 MB\n085 Akash Ka Jadugar.pdf\t14.45 MB\n086 Shaitan Ka Top.pdf\t12.11 MB\n087 Icchadhaari Ram.cbr\t28.19 MB\n088 Phir Aaya Dracula.pdf\t22.21 MB\n089 Dracula Ka Pretjaal.pdf\t8.54 MB\n090 Dracula Aaya Maut Laya.pdf\t8.07 MB\n091 Spider Gang.pdf\t5.08 MB\n092 Seshnaag Ka Khazana.pdf\t4.57 MB\n093 Kingara.pdf\t23.70 MB\n094 Kala Angara.pdf\t4.08 MB\n096 Silent Curfew.pdf\t9.36 MB\n097 Silencer Ki Maut.pdf\t5.68 MB\n098 Staro Ki Partigya.pdf\t9.57 MB\n099 Aathwa Ajooba.pdf\t9.42 MB\n100 Divyashaki Ka Beta.pdf\t8.74 MB\nBONUS COMICS/Kaali Khopdi_Trikaldev-Crookbond.cbr\t23.64 MB\n\nscreenshot:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/50243266439194702152.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/50243266439194702152.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/21296532177281555642.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/21296532177281555642.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/60241482070806628713.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/60241482070806628713.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nTHANKS TO THE ORIGINAL UPLOADERS.\nPLEASE COMMENT IF YOU LIKE THEM.\nAND REMEMBER TO SEED AS LONG AS YOU CAN AND HELP THE NEEDFULL\nTHANKS\n-SANJEET","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:447cfebd3dd5ecaedfdeda3206905fc8a88344c4","amp;dn":"+MANOJ+COMICS+%28HINDI%29+RAM-RAHIM+SET-05","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"447cfebd3dd5ecaedfdeda3206905fc8a88344c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,124,254,189,61,213,236,174,223,222,218,50,6,144,95,200,168,131,68,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
