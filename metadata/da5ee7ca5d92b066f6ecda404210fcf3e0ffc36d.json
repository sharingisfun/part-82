It was published in the United Kingdom as God Is Not Great: The Case Against Religion.\n\nHitchens contends that organised religion is &quot;violent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism, tribalism, and bigotry, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children&quot;, and that accordingly it &quot;ought to have a great deal on its conscience.&quot; Hitchens supports his position with a mixture of personal stories, documented historical anecdotes and critical analysis of religious texts. His commentary focuses mainly on the Abrahamic religions, although he also touches on other religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da5ee7ca5d92b066f6ecda404210fcf3e0ffc36d","amp;dn":"Christopher+Hitchen%5C%27s+-+God+Is+Not+Great","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da5ee7ca5d92b066f6ecda404210fcf3e0ffc36d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,94,231,202,93,146,176,102,246,236,218,64,66,16,252,243,224,255,195,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
