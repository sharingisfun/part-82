He knows that Atlantis was real, and he can get there if he has the mysterious Shephards journal, which can guide him to Atlantis. But he needs someone to fund a voyage. His employer thinks he's dotty, and refuses to fund any crazy idea. He returns home to his apartment and finds a woman there. She takes him to Preston B. Whitmore, an old friend of his Grandfathers. He gives him the shepherds journal, a submarine and a 5 star crew. They travel through the Atlantic ocean, face a large lobster called the Leviathan, and finally get to Atlantis. But does the Atlantis crew have a lust for discovery, or something else?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:932edb18c619da4e45ceefdc075d91343ba98ab8","amp;dn":"Atlantis%3A+The+Lost+Empire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"932edb18c619da4e45ceefdc075d91343ba98ab8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,46,219,24,198,25,218,78,69,206,239,220,7,93,145,52,59,169,138,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
