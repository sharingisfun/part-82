Tom Reagan is the laconic anti-hero of this amoral tale which is also, paradoxically, a look at morals within the criminal underworld of the 1930s. Two rival gangs vie for control of a city where the police are pawns, and the periodic busts of illicit drinking establishments are no more than a way for one gang to get back at the other. Black humour and shocking violence compete for screen time as we question whether or not Tom, right-hand man of the Irish mob leader, really has a heart.\nRuntime..: 115 minutes\nFilmed in: USA\nLanguages: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e438877a3d137e3761448a2a36591a19ada96b1","amp;dn":"Millers.Crossing.1990.HDTV.720p.AC3.x264-DiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e438877a3d137e3761448a2a36591a19ada96b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,67,136,119,163,209,55,227,118,20,72,162,163,101,145,161,154,218,150,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
