It is episode 23.\n\nThe Case of Sherlock Holmes was a feature in the BBC's well-respected 40 Minutes strand (despite lasting nearly twice that length) described by its makers as &quot;a documentary entertainment&quot;. It's a detailed look at the whole, sometimes bizarre, world that's grown up around the character: everything from Old Foggy London Town package tours for wealthy Americans to serious literary scholars, from historical and social analysts to the dedicated group who make a yearly pilgrimage to the tiny US town of Moriarty to heap abuse on the head of Holmes's greatest enemy and sing &quot;Happy Unbirthday, You Bastard&quot; in his memory. The many film and TV extracts include some real rarities, including a brief clip of Leonard Nimoy in the role. The programme is presented by Tim Pigott-Smith, who has played both Holmes and Watson. Oh - keep watching afterthe closing credits for a couple of tiny but nice codas. Written by Brian Thompson &amp; David Pearson and produced by David Pearson. Aired on BBC2 on 10th December 1987.\n\nType: avi\nLength: 1:09:40\nSize: 229 mb\nFrame Size: 512x384\nFrame Rate: 25 frames/second\nData Rate: 413 kbs\nVideo Codec: XviD\nAudio Codec: MPGA\nAudio Bitrate: 48 kbs\nTotal Bitrate: 461 kbs\n\nThis is not an original rip.
