It was released in 1993 as the third single from their fifth album, Countdown to Extinction. The song charted at #29 on the US Mainstream Rock chart and at #26 in the UK.\n\nThe term &quot;to sweat bullets&quot; means to be very nervous or anxious about something. About the lyrics, Dave Mustaine stated &quot;I wrote that about myself. It was pointed out to me that I'm kind of schizophrenic and that I live inside my head. Which is something I don't subscribe to, but I enjoyed the theory nonetheless.&quot;, and &quot;I think all of us are sweating bullets all the time. Society's a joke right now, and people are getting more and more hostile. When you think about having an evil twin or schizophrenia, I think a lot of us are schizo, because we live inside our heads. There's someone we all confer with; it's called our conscience. Some people cannot control their other side; it takes them over. Everybody has that psychotic side. Everyone has a thing that will make them snap.&quot;\n\nThe song was one of the many songs deemed inappropriate after the September 11th terrorist attacks.\n\nIt is featured in the 2009 video game Guitar Hero 5.\n\nCountdown to Extinction is the fifth studio album by the American heavy metal band Megadeth. It was released on July 14, 1992 through Combat Records. Countdown to Extinction  is Megadeth's best-selling album, with over two million copies sold and achieving double platinum status. The album also produced the band's most successful hit singles, &quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot;, &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot;, &quot;Skin O' My Teeth&quot; and &quot;Foreclosure of a Dream&quot;, videos were made for all singles and also for &quot;High Speed Dirt&quot;.\n\nCountdown to Extinction was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards.\n\nMegadeth is an American heavy metal band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1983. Founded by guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine and bassist Dave Ellefson following Mustaine's departure from Metallica, the band has since released 12 studio albums, three live albums, two EPs, 26 singles, 32 music videos, four compilations and one box set. As a pioneer of the American thrash metal movement, Megadeth rose to international fame in the 1980s and was ranked as one of the &quot;Big Four of Thrash,&quot; along with Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax, who were responsible for creating, developing and popularizing the thrash metal sub-genre.\n\nMegadeth has experienced numerous line-up changes, due partly to the band's notorious substance-abuse problems. From 1983 to 2002 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and as of February 8, 2010 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mustaine and Ellefson are the only continuous members of the band. After finding sobriety and securing a stable line-up, Megadeth went on to release a string of platinum and gold albums, including the platinum-selling landmark Rust in Peace in 1990 and the Grammy nominated, multi-platinum Countdown to Extinction in 1992.\n\nMegadeth disbanded in 2002 after Mustaine suffered a severe nerve injury to his left arm. However, following extensive physical therapy, Mustaine reformed the band in 2004 and released The System Has Failed, followed by United Abominations in 2007; the albums debuted on the Billboard Top 200 chart at #18 and #8, respectively. Megadeth, along with their new lead guitarist Chris Broderick, released their twelfth studio album, titled Endgame, on September 15, 2009, which debuted at #9 on the Billboard 200.\n\nIn the band's 25 active years, Megadeth has had 20 official members, with Dave Mustaine remaining as the driving force and main songwriter. Megadeth is known for its distinctive instrumental style, often featuring dense, intricate passages and trade off guitar solos. As well as his recurring lyrical themes including politics, war, addiction, personal relationships and religious themes. Megadeth has sold over 25 million albums worldwide, with five consecutive albums being certified platinum or multi-platinum in the USA. The band has also been nominated eight consecutive times for Best Metal Performance.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c785945eeb193c52b6107625ccef715a04bae87f","amp;dn":"Megadeth+-+Sweating+Bullets+%28Live%29+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c785945eeb193c52b6107625ccef715a04bae87f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,133,148,94,235,25,60,82,182,16,118,37,204,239,113,90,4,186,232,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
