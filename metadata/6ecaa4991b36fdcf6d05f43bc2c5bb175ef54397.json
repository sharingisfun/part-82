K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) are the toughest and most famous cops in the city with the best capture rate no matter what it takes to get their man, even if the city must pay $12 million in property damages to capture a small crook. However, in their ranks, there are two other detectives that are want-to-be heroes sitting in the wings. Detective Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) just want their chance in the sun to make a big collar and get a medal too. They get their chance when a small case falls into their lap which ends up being a very big high-profile case instead. It's the opportunity they have been waiting for, but do they have what it takes to be the next police heroes. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy) \n\nREVIEW\n\nI saw the advanced screening tonight in New York City and it was hilarious. The dry humor was tremendous and the chemistry between Marky Mark and Will Ferrell is unmatched. They were so funny together it was great. The story of the movie is pretty predictable but there legit is non stop laughter through the entire film. The only draw back was the length of the movie, they could have trimmed it a bit but overall it's a solid summer comedy. Dare I say this was Will Ferrell's best performance since Anchorman. It's certainly one of those movies you will be quoting with your friends for a long time. The entire theater was laughing throughout the entire thing..Great movie...go check it out.\n\n\nSAMPLE INCLUDED.....\n\nSCREENS HERE......\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/8006/003343.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/8006/003343.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/9549/005034.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/9549/005034.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/5923/010726.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/5923/010726.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPLEASE HELP SEED AND BE PATIENT AS MY UPLOAD SPEED IS CAPPED!!!\n\n\nTHANKS!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ecaa4991b36fdcf6d05f43bc2c5bb175ef54397","amp;dn":"The+Other+Guys+2010+TS+XviD-TA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ecaa4991b36fdcf6d05f43bc2c5bb175ef54397","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,202,164,153,27,54,253,207,109,5,244,59,194,197,187,23,94,245,67,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
