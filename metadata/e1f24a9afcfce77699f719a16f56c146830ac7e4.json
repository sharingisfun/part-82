With  several |\n| experienced metalheads from other local  metalbands, a new and loud band was |\n| born in Alkmaar, North of Holland.                                           |\n|                                                                              |\n| Bloid means  'happy' in  dutch  dialect.  Happy name,  heavy music!  What is |\n| interesting about Bloid is that it  is not a typical metalband with an angry |\n| attitude.  Enjoy to play  music and having  fun is much  more important than |\n| creating an heavy image.  This attituce has  brought the  band a lot of gigs |\n| and created lots of goodwill with bookers and venues.                        |\n|                                                                              |\n| Bloid is Rijnes on bass and vocals,  Jeroen on guitar and vocals and Daan on |\n| drums. Watching Bloid live is fresh and heavy at the same time. Enthousiasm, |\n| energy  and power  are  just a  few  key words  to describe  the  Bloid live |\n| sensation: Metal at its best!                                                |\n|                                                                              |\n| Now 2010 Bloid steps in the ring with a new kick ass EP 'Momentum'. This new |\n| mini album is a new chapter in  the Bloid history. The album is faster, more |\n| technical and more brutal  than the all the previous songs.  Musically Bloid |\n| has a real powerful  sound which is a wake up call to  all metalheads around |\n| the world.                                                                   |\n|                                                                              |\n| Released ............ 2010                                                   |\n| Recorded ............
