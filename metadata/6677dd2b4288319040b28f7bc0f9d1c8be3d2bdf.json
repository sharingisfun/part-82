It is a more difficult job than for normal \n\nmovies.The dialects and accents mixed in with occasional faulty audio recording \n\nmade it impossible even to make a guess as to what is said in several places of \n\n&quot;I Dies From Love&quot;. These places (phrases) are put in parentheses, rather than \n\nreplaced by a series of dashes or periods, so you can see my best guess. I am \n\ngaining skill in recognizing mistakes in subtitles during subsequent viewing. So \n\nperhaps later I will come back and correct the mistakes in this upload. \n\n\nRemember, these are your subtitles. Do with them what you will.  If you don't like \n\nwhat I've done, get yourself a copy of Subtitle Workshop and teach yourself how \n\nto edit my words. As time goes by perhaps some of you in a younger generation will \n\npick up my work and improve it and extend it.\n\n\nMany old people here in my retirement home say they would have enjoyed \n\nwatching the movie better if it weren't for the &quot;silly&quot; letters at the bottom of \n\nthe picture. After watching movies with subtitles displayed (for my wife's \n\nbenefit) I have developed a desire to have subtitles displayed on all videos, \n\nregular television shows or not. It seems to me now that experiencing the spoken \n\nword with two senses (sight and hearing) gives me a better comprehension of the \n\nstory. \n\n\nInformation about the whole series at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.updown.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.updown.org.uk/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLyrics of the songs at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.updown.org.uk/sounds/lyrics.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.updown.org.uk/sounds/lyrics.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\njgordon20904\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b0dad7dfc2d4dfde8280898084f0d3dfddd3d1c3c49eded5c4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6677dd2b4288319040b28f7bc0f9d1c8be3d2bdf","amp;dn":"Upstairs%2C+Downstairs+subtitle+update+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6677dd2b4288319040b28f7bc0f9d1c8be3d2bdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,119,221,43,66,136,49,144,64,178,143,123,192,249,209,200,190,61,43,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
