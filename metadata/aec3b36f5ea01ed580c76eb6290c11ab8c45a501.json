Some essays are expressions of simple outrage. Others probe more deeply into IsraelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s broader political strategy in the region and its human costs for Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. Author and Harvard scholar Sarah RoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s essay offers a detailed and rigorous accounting of GazaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s humanitarian and economic woes, while well-known academic and blogger Juan ColeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s excellent contribution emphasizes the deeper problem of Palestinian statelessness, the political fact of which the Gaza blockade and even the Israeli occupation itself are merely symptomatic.\n\nBut perhaps most urgently, and certainly most befitting a work so quickly assembled after the incident, the bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eyewitness accounts from activists aboard the flotilla and essays from their sympathizers represent an attempt to recapture a narrative of the event. As their testimonies indicate repeatedly, Israeli soldiers confiscated laptops, cameras, and other recording devices when they arrested and detained the activists for several days. This enabled Israeli public relations officials to fill a vacuum of information about the event and the parties involved with a media campaign described by filmmaker and flotilla activist Iara Lee as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œaggressively dishonest.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Every eyewitness account in the book attests to several key facts. The activists carried no weapons. The Israeli soldiers boarded at night in international waters, which means that they were by definition aggressors who cannot claim to have acted in self-defense. They fired on the flotilla before boarding and without warning, and several of those killed were shot multiple times from close range in the back or back of the head.\n\nJournalist Max Blumenthal and other contributors, however, illustrate how Israeli officials propagated false or misleading claims that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œal-Qaeda mercenariesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ were among those aboard the ships, that the passengers were carrying weapons (using photographs of kitchen knives and boating equipment as evidence), and that the activists were yelling anti-Semitic slurs (accompanying this claim with a doctored audio clip). Blumenthal describes drawing confessions from IDF officials that such claims were baseless, even while these and other reports have persisted without retraction in Israeli and Western media outlets. To this end, Midnight on the Mavi Marmara represents a critical re-litigation of the events that reclaims the activistsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ humanitarian intentions.\n\nWithin hours, outrage at Israel's action echoes around the world. Spontaneous demonstrations in Europe, the United States, Turkey, and Gaza itself denounce the attack.  Turkey's prime minister describes it as a &quot;bloody massacre&quot; and &quot;state terrorism.&quot; Lebanon's prime minister calls it &quot;a dangerous and crazy step that will exacerbate tensions in the region.&quot;\n\nIn these pages, a range of activists, journalists, and analysts piece together the events that occurred that May night, unpicking their meanings for Israel's illegal, three-year-long blockade of Gaza and the decades-long Israel/Palestine conflict more generally. Mixing together first-hand testimony, documentary record, and illustration, with hard-headed analysis and historical overview, Midnight on the Mavi Marmara reveals why the attack on Gaza Freedom Flotilla may just turn out to be Israel's Selma, Alabama: the beginning of the end for an apartheid Palestine.\n\n\nBlurb:\n\nEastern Mediterranean, Monday, May 31st, 2010, 4.30am: Israeli commandos, boarding from sea and air, attack the six boats of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla as it sails through international waters bringing humanitarian relief to the beleaguered Palestinians of Gaza.  Within minutes, nine peace activists are dead, shot by the Israelis. Scores of others are injured.  The 700 people on board the ships are arrested before being transported to detention centers in Israel and then deported.\n\n\nPublished by O/R Books, an independent publisher that sells directly online.
