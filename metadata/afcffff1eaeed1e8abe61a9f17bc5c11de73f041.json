Where some people have seen a celebrity do-gooder, we found instead a committed and patient man, realistic, but very much in touch with the idealist in himself. We have since had many requests to replay the interview. And with U2's postponed Australian tour finally about to happen, we thought we'd take the opportunity to do just that. Meet the Bono that you don't see on stage.\n\nNot sure how popular this will be, but for those that are interested in U2, and bono, then you may want to get an insight into his works.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s1777012.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s1777012.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.ConspiracyHub Com\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE.
