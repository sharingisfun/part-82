Go. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:536794a8c7eb385372da2e99422bb4b365788c2b","amp;dn":"Hikbi+%282009%29+DVDRip+XViD+%28Pinoy%29+sribats75","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"536794a8c7eb385372da2e99422bb4b365788c2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,103,148,168,199,235,56,83,114,218,46,153,66,43,180,179,101,120,140,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
