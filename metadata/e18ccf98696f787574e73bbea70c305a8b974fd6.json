A horde of enemies is invading, and it's up to the player to stop them by strategically building fortification towers around their base. Beautiful environments, spectacular effects, and a dynamic, engaging soundtrack bring the world to life. The controls are intuitive and the gameplay is deep ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the special attacks and properties of each tower work together to provide many ways to succeed.\n\nDefense Grid: Borderlands is the highly challenging expansion that not only provides four new maps and multiple challenge modes for each map, but it also brings 3 new challenge types to Defense Grid, adding a total of 30 new challenge modes across the original 20 maps in the Awakening campaign. Super Grinder, Campaign Reversed, and Poison Core modes create new strategic situations and require new approaches to solve.\n\nDefense Grid: Resurgence is the first set of premium expansion for Defense Grid: The Awakening and is made up of 8 new highly polished and balanced maps from the original creators. Each week in June over four consecutive weeks a new pair of maps will be released providing new environments and strategic experiences and requiring new ways of thinking to beat back the aliens and protect your cores. Each map pack contains 2 maps each with a campaign mode and 4 additional modes associated with the design of that level. New Steam achievements and high-score leaderboards are associated with each map pack.\n\nSystem requirements:\n\n+ Operating system: Windows XP/Vista/7\n+ Processor: 1.8GHz CPU or higher\n+ Memory: 512 MB RAM\n+ Hard drive space: 1GB\n+ DirectX: DirectX 9.0c\n+ Video: Video card with DirectX support 9 and shaders 2:\nATI Radeon 9600 (96009800, X300X1950, HD 2400HD 4870)\nNVIDIA GeForce 6100 (61006800, 71007950, 83008800, 96009800, GTX 216280)\n\nInstall Notes:\n\nRun Installer: Defense.Grid.Gold.v1.0.THETA.exe\n\n\nRemember to seed.\n\nupper_United","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e18ccf98696f787574e73bbea70c305a8b974fd6","amp;dn":"Defense.Grid.Gold.v1.0.THETA.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e18ccf98696f787574e73bbea70c305a8b974fd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,140,207,152,105,111,120,117,116,231,59,190,167,12,48,90,139,151,79,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
