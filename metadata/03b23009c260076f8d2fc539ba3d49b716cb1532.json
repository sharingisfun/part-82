If you love The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, Dear John or any of his other tear-jerker books, then you'll love this one I found from a new writer called Jeff Rivera.  Don't let the first few pages fool you, it's not a ghetto book. You're going to love it and cry at the end just like I did.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03b23009c260076f8d2fc539ba3d49b716cb1532","amp;dn":"NICHOLAS+SPARKS+FANS%3A+FOREVER+MY+LADY+BY+JEFF+RIVERA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03b23009c260076f8d2fc539ba3d49b716cb1532","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,178,48,9,194,96,7,111,141,47,197,57,186,61,73,183,22,203,21,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
