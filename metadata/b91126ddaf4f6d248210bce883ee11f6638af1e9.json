With PowerArchiver's Virtual Drive feature, you can also mount .ISO images into Windows so they appear like a normal drive and you can browse inside.\nCD/DVD/Blu-ray Burner\n\nIn addition to creating and mounting .ISO images, you can now burn archives, images and any files directly from PowerArchiver or via Explorer Shell Extensions to a CD, DVD or Blu-ray disc. Once you're done, you can verify the burned files to make sure everything was burned correctly and without errors.\nBuilt-in FTP Client\n\nSave time with PowerArchiver 2010! No longer do you need to open a separate file transfer program to upload or download files or archives. PowerArchiver 2010 includes a built-in FTP client so you can connect to a remote server, view and retrieve files, and easily upload archives or the files contained in them.\nAdvanced Backup\n\nPowerArchiver's Backup feature has been expanded to include direct CD/DVD/BD burning of your backup archives, 3 possible local destionations, 7-Zip compression, detailed logs that can be e-mailed, and an advanced built-in scheduler.\nPowerArchiver 2010 Features:\nPreview Window\n\nWith PowerArchiver 2010, you can now easily preview archives, images, text and many other file types directly in PowerArchiver without having to open archive or file. The Preview feature works both while browsing hard drives and inside archives, with full support for WLX plug-ins.\nFull Windows 7 Support\n\nFull Windows 7 support with jump lists, taskbar progress and taskbar icon overlays. First archiver to do so.\n\nYou do not need to worry about compatibility problems with PowerArchiver if you are using or considering upgrading to Windows 7 - we have done extensive testing to ensure everything works perfectly. PowerArchiver also runs great on all other Windows versions, from Windows 98 to Windows Vista, both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.\nBrand new ZIP Engine\n\nZIP Support PowerArchiver offers superior ZIP format support compared to other archivers. Here are the highlights:\n\n    * Multicore deflate zip engine, almost 4x faster than single core systems on quad core computers.\n    * Improved speed of zip compression and extraction on any occassion.\n    * Full support for advanced ZIPX format - LZMA, JPEG, PPMd, BZIP2 and WAVPACK in ZIP/ZIPX, according to latest ZIP standards. PowerArchiver is the only application that fully supports Winzip 14 and earlier files, while providing faster (up to 4x) and stronger compression compared to WinZip 14.\n    * Full support for more basic ZIP format that is compatible with all archivers out there, as well as the built-in Windows XP/Vista/7 zip reader.\n    * Multicore LZMA engine for ZIP.\n    * Support for Unicode in ZIP, both read and write. Implemented throughout application.\n    * ZIP AES support (both PkZip 5.1 and WZ 9.0 standards supported)\n    * Multiple disk spanning, with support for unlimited span sizes\n\n7-Zip Compression\n\n7-Zip is an advanced compression format featured in PowerArchiver. It is an open source format, providing an open architecture and high compression ratio. 7-Zip outperforms ZIP, ACE and even RAR in many tests. However, 7-Zip's greatest strength is that it is not controlled by any organization or individual, but by an open source LGPL project to which anyone can contribute. More information on 7-Zip and its superior compression can be found at 7-Zip.org.\n\nPowerArchiver also features a Transparent Update feature for 7-Zip archives, which allows you to quickly add or remove files even if the archive is &quot;Solid.&quot;\nSuperior RAR extraction\n\nIn PowerArchiver 2010, we have spent months of development time to custom tune extraction of RAR archives. End result is that we now have the fastest RAR extraction engine on the market, which extracts up to 30% faster than everyone else, including WinRar!\nMultiple Formats Support Including ISO\n\nPowerArchiver has native support for most popular compressed and encoded formats currently in use. All formats are fully integrated into PowerArchiver, so you can utilize all PowerArchiver tools with each of them.\n\n    * Read and write support for ZIP, 7-ZIP, CAB, LHA (LZH), TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, BH, XXE, UUE, yENC, and MIME (Base 64)\n    * Read and extract support for: RAR, ARJ, ARC, ACE, ZOO plus ISO, BIN, IMG and NRG disc image formats\n    * Brand new Plug-in System enables new formats and file types to be supported with a small download.\n\nNew Queue System (Add/Extract/Backup) and PowerArchiver Starter\n\nAn innovative Queue System has been added to PowerArchiver. This is the first time such an option is available in compression utility, and it enables you to better organize your compression, extraction and backups, as well as schedule multiple jobs to be done sequentially without slowing down your system - as multiple compressions would do if run all at once. Another first for PowerArchiver.\n\nPowerArchiver Starter is a brand new system tray application for managing your Queue and launching the most recently used archives and backups. PowerArchiver Starter has been written in an assembler-like language for minimum size and memory usage.\nUnmatched Security\n\nEncrypt PowerArchiver comes with an unprecedented level of security features. Not only does it fully support the new ZIP AES standard, PowerArchiver also offers its proprietary PAE standard for additional security with five different encryption methods. For ease of use, the PowerArchiver Password Manager will save your frequently used passwords so you do not need to remember them.\n\n    * Full support for ZIP AES encryption, 128-bit/192-bit/256-bit (supports: PKZip 5.1 (full), Secure Zip 8.0 and WinZip 9.0 AE-1 &amp; AE-2)\n    * PAE support - Encryption of files and archives using 5 different methods: Blowfish (128-bit), DES (64-bit), Triple DES (128-bit), AES 128-bit, and AES 256-bit\n\nAutomated Backups\n\nBackup Security vulnerabilities have become a major problem in Windows, which means it is critical to backup and protect your important data. With PowerArchiver's built-in Backup Wizard, it is a breeze to backup your files.\n\nBy using a step-by-step wizard, you will be able to add files and folders, filter them based on your specifications, use 5 different compressions formats, add password protection, and even upload your backup to an FTP or SFTP (SSH) server directly!\n\nTo keep your backups secure from prying eyes, you can also encrypt the archives using ZIP AES encryption.\nGuaranteed Compatibility and Explorer Integration\n\nExplorer Integration PowerArchiver has pioneered advanced Shell Extensions that let you compress, extract and encrypt files using one click from within Windows Explorer -- without opening PowerArchiver. In PowerArchiver 2010, we have improved shell extensions even more and added comress/extract MRU and FTP profiles so you can FTP directly from shell extensions!\n\nNot only that, but PowerArchiver also offers an option to use an Explorer-like interface for browsing your hard drive for archives, which also supports shell integration.\n\nPowerArchiver features Hybrid Shell Extensions, which puts less frequently used options in an easy to access submenu.\nCompression Profiles\n\nFor ease of use, PowerArchiver has Compression Profiles that store frequently used compression settings. You can select a compression profile when performing operations in PowerArchiver and save considerable time.\nUseful Tools\n\nMulti-Extract PowerArchiver has the most advanced set of tools that you can use to manage your archives:\n\n    * Convert Tool - convert files among formats supported in PowerArchiver.

You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.\n\n\nThis has also been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista/W7 machine. It's up to you to check it if you are using them.\n\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS\n==================================\n\n1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.\n\n\n2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.\n\n\n3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) \n\n\n4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.\n\n\nThat's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.\n\n\nThat's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b91126ddaf4f6d248210bce883ee11f6638af1e9","amp;dn":"PowerArchiver+Pro+v11.63.13+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b91126ddaf4f6d248210bce883ee11f6638af1e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,17,38,221,175,79,109,36,130,16,188,232,131,238,17,246,99,138,241,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
