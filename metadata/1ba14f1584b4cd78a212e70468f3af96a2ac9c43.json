Contains live and promotional footage from their 1997 album Urban Hymns along with some early material. The video contains their homecoming performance at Wigan's Haigh Hall in Lancashire, England, along with music videos and Richard Ashcroft's acoustic demo performance of &quot;Drugs Don't Work.&quot; Other highlights include a previously unreleased version of &quot;Space and Time,&quot; an instrumental version of &quot;Velvet Morning,&quot; and the video for &quot;Bittersweet Symphony.&quot; In between the songs, members of the band offer up brief interview segments set in the background of the performance footage.\n\nI was looking for this online for years so now I have found it I thought I'd better share. It is only a VHS rip as this never made it to DVD. It is an amazing film about an amazing band. \n\nCome On","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ba14f1584b4cd78a212e70468f3af96a2ac9c43","amp;dn":"The+Verve+-+The+Video+96+-+98++%28VHS+RIP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ba14f1584b4cd78a212e70468f3af96a2ac9c43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,161,79,21,132,180,205,120,162,18,231,4,104,243,175,150,162,172,156,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
