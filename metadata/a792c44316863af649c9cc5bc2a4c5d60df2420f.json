Oceanography and Marine Biology: An Annual Review has answered this demand since its founding by the late Harold Barnes more than forty years ago. Its objective is an annual consideration of basic areas of marine research, dealing with subjects of special or immediate importance, adding new subjects as they arise.\n\nThe volumes maintain a unified perspective on the marine sciences. Physical, chemical, and biological aspects of marine science are dealt with by experts actively engaged in these fields. This essential reference text for researchers and students in all fields of marine science finds a place in libraries of marine stations and institutes, as well as universities. It consistently ranks among the highest in impact factors for the marine biology category of the citation indices compiled by the Institute for Scientific Information.\n\nVolume 43 contains analysis on cold seep sediments, unburnt coal in the marine environment, biofiltration and biofouling on artificial structures in Europe, ecology of rafting in marine ecosystems, effects of globalisation in marine environments, and much more.\n\n- crcpress.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a792c44316863af649c9cc5bc2a4c5d60df2420f","amp;dn":"Oceanography+and+Marine+Biology%3A+An+Annual+Review+-+Volume+43","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a792c44316863af649c9cc5bc2a4c5d60df2420f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,146,196,67,22,134,58,246,73,201,204,91,194,164,197,214,13,242,66,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
