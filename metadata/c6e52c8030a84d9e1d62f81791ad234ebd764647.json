Twenty-eight years later, the initial welcome by the human population has faded. The refugee camp where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus van der Merwe in charge. In this operation, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new 'Prawn' friends. \n\n \n\nRelease Date: 14th, August 2009 (USA)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6e52c8030a84d9e1d62f81791ad234ebd764647","amp;dn":"District+9+%5BRated+R%5D%5BUploaded+by+Vostok%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6e52c8030a84d9e1d62f81791ad234ebd764647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,229,44,128,48,168,77,158,29,98,248,23,145,173,35,78,189,118,70,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
