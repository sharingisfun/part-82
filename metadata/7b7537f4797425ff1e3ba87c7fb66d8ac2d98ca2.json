Based on TH White's beloved novel The Once and Future King, this Disney version chronicles King Arthur's boyish adventures. There's much to enjoy here as coach Merlin the magician shows the young Arthur, nicknamed Wart, the skills that will help him become the future ruler of the Britons. The transformation sequences, where the boy is turned into a fish, a bird and a squirrel are vintage Disney. The oft-repeated scene of Merlin battling it out with mean old Madame Mim still is worth a few chuckles, but it underlines the problem with most of the film--most of its scenes are only played for laughs. References by Merlin to television and other items of modern life also mar the generally innocuous landscape. Younger children will like it, while older kids will find it slower compared with recent Disney films\n\n\n4 audio channels\n\nGeneral : C:\\Users\\winker\\Desktop\\DISNEYS-SWORD IN THE STONE[1963] 45TH ANNIV EDITION-AC3 5.1 XVID[MULTI AUDIO BY WINKER@1337X\\sword in the stone.avi\nFormat : AVI at 1 676 Kbps\nLength : 914 MiB for 1h 16mn 14s 920ms\n\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual at 998 Kbps\nAspect : 716 x 574 (1.331) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0 : MPEG Audio at 160 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nAudio #1 : MPEG Audio at 160 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nAudio #2 : MPEG Audio at 160 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nAudio #3 : MPEG Audio at 160 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b7537f4797425ff1e3ba87c7fb66d8ac2d98ca2","amp;dn":"DISNEYS-SWORD+IN+THE+STONE%5B1963%5D+45TH+ANNIV+EDITION-AC3+5.1+XVID","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b7537f4797425ff1e3ba87c7fb66d8ac2d98ca2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,117,55,244,121,116,37,255,30,59,168,124,127,182,109,138,194,217,140,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
