This is the one that started the Bullets, Bombs, &amp; Babes theme that he later perfected. Basically a Russ Meyer for the mid 80s and 90s, who really liked to blow shit up.\nAccording to some guy on Amazon, Leonard Maltin called this one  &quot;a loose remake of his 1973 film Stacey&quot;\n\nThere will  be much more to come if they're wanted. I have 8 others from the collection, including one his son (Christian Drew Sidaris) directed. I considered doing all 7 of the Andy directed films as one collection, but decided that my connection and lack of seedbox doesn't warrant such a massive single upload.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a53e0c88939255ab54dd3a3cf4d6a9916774e92f","amp;dn":"Malibu+Express+%281985%29+NTSC+DVD9+VIDEO_TS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a53e0c88939255ab54dd3a3cf4d6a9916774e92f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,62,12,136,147,146,85,171,84,221,58,60,244,214,169,145,103,116,233,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
