Musically his production work takes influences from UK, Jamaica, the US, North Africa and French music. The album is an intense lyrical journey with temptation, reflection, mischief and misbehavior. There's a wealth of knowledge distilled within the music as Tricky approaches twenty years of recording. &quot;Every album is a learning experience and this is concentrated music, there's no dilution&quot; said Tricky of his new collection, &quot;I've spent my life going between cultures; Mixed Race is about that in a very direct way.&quot; \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9d81e3f1b6038e9c2f153a65c2740438085e5ec","amp;dn":"Tricky+-+Mixed+Race+%5Bmp3-vbr-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9d81e3f1b6038e9c2f153a65c2740438085e5ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,216,30,63,27,96,56,233,194,241,83,166,92,39,64,67,128,133,229,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
