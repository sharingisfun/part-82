Tyson's shocking book Target America - The Influence of Communist Propaganda on the U.S. Media (1983) which exposes a massive communist secret propaganda campaign through the media that influenced U.S. policy on defense, intelligence and foreign affairs. Tyson had a wide-ranging career that began with Time Inc. before World War II. During the war, he worked in Europe for the Office of Strategic Services and played a key role in identifying industrial and military targets behind German lines. After the war, he returned to Time Life, where he worked in market research for the company's international division. He moved to IBM in 1964 as market research manager for its operations in Asia. In 1972, he traveled to South Vietnam and wrote about the country's progress in agriculture and social welfare. He was dismayed that U.S. news coverage of Southeast Asia often overlooked these advances. Three years later, communist forces drove the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government from power and assumed control of the country. While working at IBM's headquarters, he grew outspoken with his concern that U.S. newsrooms had become hotbeds of communist infiltration. The author believed that at least 4,000 U.S. journalists were furthering Soviet propaganda goals, particularly in television network news. He recommended that each network be required to have an ombudsman to ensure balanced reporting. That the major media outlets in the US are by and large committed leftists is today self evident to any perceptive person who cares to take notice. The question is how much was due to Soviet activity and how much was due to people just being ignorant and foolish. Target America serves to document the committed influence of the Soviets on those whom we trusted to tell us the truth and how communist propaganda is still used to demoralize and mislead the American public. 145 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:465a1880736ec3f9002453b6bfab427d84dc9e53","amp;dn":"Tyson-Target+America-Influence+of+Communist+Propaganda+on+US+Med","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"465a1880736ec3f9002453b6bfab427d84dc9e53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,90,24,128,115,110,195,249,0,36,83,182,191,171,66,125,132,220,158,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
