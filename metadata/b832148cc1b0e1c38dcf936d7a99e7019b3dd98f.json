For this album, Simon Nicol returned after an absence of five years although he had contributed some guitar to the previous record, Gottle O'Geer and mixed the album. It was recorded between August 1976 and March 1977 at Island Studios, London.\n\n\n\n Jams O'Donnells Jig   2:33 \n2 The Eynsham Poacher   2:24 \n3 Adieu Adieu   2:30 \n4 The Bonny Bunch of Roses   12:27 \n5 The Poor Ditching Boy   3:57 \n6 General Taylor   3:10 \n7 Run Johnny Run   4:35 \n8 The Last Waltz   3:00 \n9 Royal Seleccion No. 13  [Haste to the Wedding / Clarke's Hornpipe / Parade Of The Tin Soldiers / The Dashing White Sergeant]   4:12 \n\n&quot;The Bonny Bunch of Roses&quot; is not regarded as one of the best Fairport albums, but in my opinion it is. Denny-era soulfulness is far away, as they are Thompson's guitar riffs or &quot;Nine&quot;'s embarassing American leanings. The mostly acoustic formula of &quot;The Bonny Bunch of Roses&quot; is closer to the one of &quot;Babbacombe&quot; Lee, but it lacks its epic atmosphere. More traditional material takes the place of Swarbrick's song cycle, and  Simon Nicol's impressive guitar slashes dominate the music. The tracks are dynamic and balanced, I'd say they're perfect, and a couple of songs are among the best of their repertoire. The long Napoleonic ballad &quot;The Bonny Bunch of Roses&quot; is amazingly built on a stripped-down sound full of silences, while &quot;Run Johnny Run&quot; features some blazing Byrdsian jingle-jangle on a hyper-kinetic 5/4 meter.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b832148cc1b0e1c38dcf936d7a99e7019b3dd98f","amp;dn":"Fairport+Convention...The+Bonny+Bunch+of+Roses%281977%29cd%282007%29%5BFLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b832148cc1b0e1c38dcf936d7a99e7019b3dd98f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,50,20,140,193,176,225,195,141,207,147,109,122,153,231,1,155,61,217,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
