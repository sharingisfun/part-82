The beautiful outline of Catbells is familiar to all who visit Derwent Water and the Lakeland town of Keswick.\n\nBy boat and by foot, Julia sets out to discover the secrets of a classic fell climb for all the family. The famous views are rich in history; where visitors walk today, miners once trod, when Catbells produced minerals more valuable than gold.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:921c991674679bc7fb8fddbad1c8a4f8448538a8","amp;dn":"Wainwright+Walks+-+S02E02+-+Catbells.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"921c991674679bc7fb8fddbad1c8a4f8448538a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,28,153,22,116,103,155,199,251,143,221,186,209,200,164,248,68,133,56,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
