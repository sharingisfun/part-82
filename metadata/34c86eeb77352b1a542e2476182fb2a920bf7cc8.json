As punishment, Diavolo orders Stanlio to hang Ollio, but gives them a second chance when Stanlio bungles the job. Taking them on as his retainers, Diavolo travels to the Tavern de Cucu in his guise as the foppish Marquis de San Marco to rob the rich, aged Lord Rocburg and woo beauteous Lady Pamela. Stanlio drives Ollio and the innkeeper to distraction by playing &quot;earsie kneesie nosie&quot; and &quot;finger wiggle,&quot; and gets drunk helping Ollio fill tankards of wine, sending him into an uncontrollable laughing fit. The boys plot to capture Diavolo but wind up with him in front of a firing squad.  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023943/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023943/&lt;/a&gt; stan laurel oliver hardy comedy 1933","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34c86eeb77352b1a542e2476182fb2a920bf7cc8","amp;dn":"1933_The_devil_s_brother","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34c86eeb77352b1a542e2476182fb2a920bf7cc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,200,110,235,119,53,43,26,84,46,36,118,24,47,178,169,32,191,124,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
