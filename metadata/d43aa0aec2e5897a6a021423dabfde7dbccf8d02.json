Later, chef Curtis Stone shows them that desserts can still be part of their lives by teaching them to prepare delicious, low-calorie cupcakes. At an early weigh-in, trainer Jillian Michaels grows frustrated with one contestant who doesn't celebrate her successes, and then trainer Bob Harper invites the players to his house for a vegan meal. Then those who fell below the yellow line face an elimination challenge involving large rolls of carpet, but one player fears elimination when sidelined by an injury. And despite two players being sent home this week, the contestants learn that the competition is about to get bigger.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d43aa0aec2e5897a6a021423dabfde7dbccf8d02","amp;dn":"The.Biggest.Loser.S10E04.HDTV.XviD-LW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d43aa0aec2e5897a6a021423dabfde7dbccf8d02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,58,160,174,194,229,137,122,106,2,20,35,218,191,222,125,188,207,141,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
