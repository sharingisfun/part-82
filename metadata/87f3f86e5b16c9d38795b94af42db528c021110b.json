The review prompted me to buy the album a little bit quicker than I would have done...unfortunately, I cannot agree. \n\nDon't get me wrong, this is a good Strawbs album and certainly better than &quot;Blue Angel&quot;, a more recent effort than the 70s (although the title track of that album is better than anything on here). &quot;Deja Fou&quot;, however, is better. \n\nDave Cousins is in fine voice and the album is fairly rocky with plenty of good guitar work from Dave Lambert and less folk-rock influence than on many other of their albums but the tunes, for me, are not strong enough to transcend the album from good to great. It's good, yes, but it's not &quot;From the Witchwood&quot;, &quot;Grave New World&quot;, &quot;Bursting at the Seams&quot; or &quot;Hero and Heroine&quot; to name a few. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87f3f86e5b16c9d38795b94af42db528c021110b","amp;dn":"Strawbs...The+Broken+Hearted+Bride%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87f3f86e5b16c9d38795b94af42db528c021110b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,243,248,110,91,22,201,211,135,149,185,74,244,45,181,40,192,33,17,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
