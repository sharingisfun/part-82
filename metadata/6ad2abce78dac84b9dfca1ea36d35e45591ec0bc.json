ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but with lovely packaging, sleeve and bio, however one spin through and Brooks Williams had my full attention! Unbelievably his 17th CD, and his first recorded in the UK, from the Statesboro, Georgia-born troubadour, who has been on the road for some 23 years, travelling the world.\n\nThis is a classy affair from start to finish, straddling the roots music boundaries of blues, folk and classic Americana. The man himself is a superb acoustic guitar fingerpicker and slide player, with a most appealing voice ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and is backed by a fine British group of musicians that comprise current Jethro Tull bass player David Goodier, folk rock veteran PJ Wright (Dobro, pedal steel and electric slide guitar), Keith Warmington (harmonica), and Helen Watson on backing vocals. He produced the album himself, with it being recorded by Andy Bell in just six days.\n\nThe 12 tracks on offer are roughly a 50/50 split of originals and covers, kicking off with the lovely tale of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFrank DelandryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a rolling folky number with some tasty slide work, with a sweet version of Son HouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGrinninÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ In Your FaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ up next, giving Keith Warmington a chance to show off his harmonica work. His own blues stomper ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWalk You Off My MindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ recalls classic Delta blues, with its ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“walkingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ guitar line and more top notch harmonica.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAll Been SaidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is quite gorgeous, with his lilting voice and just tremendous fingerpicked guitar; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLast Chance LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is an aching country tune, underpinned by PJ WrightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s weeping pedal steel guitar on this tale of long-distance love. The title track, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBaby OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is again in a country mode, with more evidence of Brooks Williams spectacular guitar playing.\n\nThe traditional ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAmazing GraceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is turned into a slide guitar instrumental ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with, I think, Williams on acoustic and PJ Wright on electric guitar, with Delta legend Mississippi John HurtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLouis CollinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ given a stunning interpretation. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMoon On DownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has a swampy John Fogarty feel to it, with contributions from all the musicians, particularly WarmingtonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s harmonica and Helen WatsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great voice.\n\nMel LondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSugar SweetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a nice blues ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ once famously covered by Freddie King ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with the closing treat being the Duke Ellington tune, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Got It Bad (And That AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t No Good), given a stripped down jazzy blues treatment, and warm vocal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ quite lovely, and representative of the quality on offer here!\n\nDefinitely one of the best things I have heard this year, and more evidence of the fine musicians out there who may not be household names, but produce music as fine as this!\n\n 1.
