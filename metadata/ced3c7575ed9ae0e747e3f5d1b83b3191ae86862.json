Gulley Jimson (Alec Guinness) is an aging artist with a reputation as a genius, though he lives an impoverished life. Jimson has reached the point in his life where he no longer feels any need to moderate his irascible persona -- he has a taste for alcohol and a tendency toward boisterous spirits where the ladies are concerned -- in search of canvasses to paint and commissions that will allow him to live comfortably, and Guinness  lives the role to the hilt. Released from jail for some indiscretion, he immediately begins harassing his wealthiest patron, Hickson (Ernest Thesiger), for money. When that fails, he insinuates himself into the home of a would-be patron, Sir William and Lady Beeder (Robert Coote, Veronica Turleigh), and manages to destroy their home and that of their downstairs neighbor with a huge block of stone and some help from a sculptor friend (Michael Gough). Courted by a potential buyer, he is desperate to retrieve one of his early works from his former wife, but even that prospect is closed off to him. Finally, with help from his young admirer, Nosey (Mike Morgan), his friend, Coker (Kay Walsh), and some art students eager to work with the legendary Gulley Jimson, he begins painting his largest canvas of all. The painting is completed and promptly destroyed. Jimson finally takes off in his wreck of a houseboat for the open sea, eyeing the huge hulls of the passing ships as potential canvasses to paint. As he disappears up the river, Coker looks on in panic and Nosey calls after him, declaring his admiration for Jimson and who he is and what his work means -- knowing for certain that he can't be heard. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : The Horse's Mouth.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.36 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 35mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 041 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 35mn\n      Bit rate : 1 839 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.667\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.312\n      Stream size : 1.23 GiB (90%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 35mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 131 MiB (9%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051739/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051739/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nMy rip of the Criterion DVD\n\nRonald Neame - The Horse's Mouth (1958) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ced3c7575ed9ae0e747e3f5d1b83b3191ae86862","amp;dn":"Ronald+Neame+-+The+Horse%5C%27s+Mouth+%281958%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ced3c7575ed9ae0e747e3f5d1b83b3191ae86862","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,211,199,87,94,217,174,14,116,126,63,93,27,131,179,25,26,232,104,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
