It is the third game in the Street Fighter Alpha series, following Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams and Street Fighter Alpha 2. The gameplay  system from the previous Alpha games was given a complete overhaul with the addition of three selectable fighting styles based on Street Fighter Alpha (A-ism), Street Fighter Alpha 2 (V-ism), and Super Street Fighter II Turbo (X-ism), new stages, a much larger roster of characters, and for the first time since the original Street Fighter II, new theme music for all the returning characters.\n\nStreet Fighter Alpha 3 discards the &quot;Manual&quot; and &quot;Auto&quot; modes from the previous Alpha games by offering the player three different playing styles known as &quot;isms&quot;. The standard playing style, A-ism (or Z-ism in Japan), is based on the previous Alpha games, in which the player has a three-level Super Combo gauge with access to several Super Combo moves. X-ism is a simple style based on Super Street Fighter II Turbo, in which the player has a single-level Super Combo gauge and access to a single (but powerful) Super Combo move. The third style, V-ism (or &quot;variable&quot; style), a unique style that allows the player to perform custom combos similar to the ones in Street Fighter Alpha 2. In X-ism, players cannot air-block nor use Alpha Counters. Alpha 3 also introduces a &quot;Guard Power Gauge&quot; which depletes each time the player blocks - if the gauge is completely depleted, then the player will remain vulnerable for an attack.\n\nThe controls for several actions has been modified from previous Alpha games. For example, the level of a Super Combo move in A-ism is now determined by the strength of the attack button pressed (i.e Medium Punch or Kick for a Lv. 2 Super Combo), rather than the number of buttons pushed; and throwing is now done by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously.\n\nAs with the previous Alpha titles, several characters were added to the game: Cammy, who was previously featured in the console-exclusive Alpha 2 Gold, makes her official Alpha debut in the game along with several characters from Street Fighter II including E. Honda, Blanka and Vega. Characters new to the Street Fighter series includes R. Mika, a Japanese female wrestler who idolizes Zangief, Karin, Sakura's rival who was first introduced in the Masahiko Nakahira manga Sakura Ganbaru!, and Cody from Final Fight, who was transformed from a vigilante into an escaped convict, makes his Street Fighter debut.\n\nThe single player mode consist of ten or eleven matches against computer-controlled opponents. The fifth and ninth opponent is a rival of the player's character who exchanges dialogue before and after the match. Unlike previous Alpha games, the final match for all the regular characters is against a more powerful version of M. Bison (officially known as Final Bison) who uses a more powerful version of the Psycho Crusher as a Super Combo. When playing as Bison, however, Ryu becomes the final opponent.\n\nDepending on the player's character, the final match with Bison will be preceded with either: a one-on-two match against Bison's female bodyguards Juni and Juli (who uses the same techniques as Cammy), or the boxer Balrog. In the arcade version, Balrog, Juni and Juli were secret characters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:106a74130fa6cd0ae20221fcebf340e71f780a55","amp;dn":"Street_Fighter_Alpha_three_psx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"106a74130fa6cd0ae20221fcebf340e71f780a55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,106,116,19,15,166,205,10,226,2,33,252,235,243,64,231,31,120,10,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
