Miles learns that  \n                    a criminal called Billy Bunhill has been shot  \n                    inside another notorious Kray haunt, The Blind  \n                    Beggar pub. Chandler's interest is piqued when  \n                    he realises that the murder mirrors George  \n                    Cornell's killing by Ronnie Kray in 1966. Who  \n                    could possibly be trading off the ghosts of the  \n                    Krays and using their legend to invoke fear and  \n                    paranoia on the streets of Whitechapel? When  \n                    the threats become personal and the killer  \n                    seems to be one step ahead, Chandler and Miles  \n                    have to wonder just how far the murderer's  \n                    power reaches.                           \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e274e72f45e0b977220b50246787d0199afa51d","amp;dn":"Whitechapel.S02E02.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e274e72f45e0b977220b50246787d0199afa51d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,39,78,114,244,94,11,151,114,32,181,2,70,120,125,1,153,175,165,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
