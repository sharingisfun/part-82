The single As Long as I Fall is download only and was released in late September.\n\nHelloween is a German power metal band founded in the mid 1980s by members of Iron Fist and Powerfool. The band is known as one of the pioneering power metal bands, being part of the German heavy/speed/power metal scene. Through the years they have influenced many bands, such as Edguy, HammerFall, Crystal Eyes, Celesty and Highland Glory.\n\nIn late 2006, Helloween filmed and recorded shows in SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Paulo (Brazil), Sofia (Bulgaria) and Tokyo (Japan), for their live album Keeper of the Seven Keys ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Legacy World Tour 2005/2006. The DVD also featured extra footage of the band as well as interviews and a road movie. This is the second Helloween live album to feature Andi Deris as frontman, and third overall. It enjoyed chart success in several countries: Germany: 9 (DVD) &amp; 58 (CD), Sweden: 9 (DVD), France: 10 (DVD).\n\nHelloween has since completed their studio album Gambling with the Devil, which was released on October 23, 2007. It received many positive reviews, with most fans praising the album as being one of the best Deris era albums. Despite being one of Helloween's heaviest albums, it is noted for featuring more keyboards. &quot;As Long As I Fall&quot;, the first single, was released in early September and available only via download (save for Japan, where it was released on CD). The video for the song is available at their official site.\n\nHelloween teamed up with Kai Hansen's current band Gamma Ray for their 2007/2008 &quot;Hellish Rock&quot; world tour, which started in early November 2007. Helloween were headlining and Gamma Ray were labeled as the &quot;very special guest&quot; with most shows also having fellow German &quot;guest&quot; Axxis. The tour went through Europe, Asia, South America as well as a few dates in the US. The tour is notable for Kai Hansen stepping on stage with his former band fellows Weikath and Grosskopf to perform hits &quot;I Want Out&quot; and &quot;Future World&quot; in the last encore segment of Helloween.\n\nOn December 26, 2009, Helloween released the Unarmed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Best of 25th Anniversary album in Japan. The album was released on February 1, 2010 in Europe. The album is a compilation of 10 of the band's best known songs, re-recorded in different musical styles than the original recordings and by the current lineup. It features a 17 minute &quot;Keepers Medley&quot;, recorded by a 70 piece orchestra from Prague, mixing together &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;The Keeper of the Seven Keys&quot;, and &quot;The King for 1000 years&quot;. There is a limited edition digipak, including a 30 minute &quot;making of&quot;-DVD with interviews and studio footage. The bands website states that the album was released on April 13, 2010 in North America via Sony &amp; THE END RECORDS labels. On May 14, 2010, it was announced on their site that they are working on a new studio album, which would be their fastest and heaviest effort in years. The release is planned for November 9.\n\nAfter the release, the band will start touring with Stratovarius as their guests.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:794617d98736fda4cadc0ccec98a844753685ec2","amp;dn":"Helloween+-+Paint+A+New+World+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"794617d98736fda4cadc0ccec98a844753685ec2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,70,23,217,135,54,253,164,202,220,12,206,201,138,132,71,83,104,94,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
