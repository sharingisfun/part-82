A year later the squad, having escaped, returns to the US, where Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw is to receive the Medal of Honor for single-handedly saving the lives of the squad. Shaw is the son of Elanor Iselin, wife of US Senator John Yerkes Iselin, and Mrs. Iselin turns the return of Raymond into a political rally that brings out building hostility between son and mother over the ambitions of Johnny Iselin. But there is more involved, for the actions of Raymond Shaw are not what everyone believes they are, and the nightmares of a US Army officer, Bennett Marco, leads to investigation of Raymond that unlocks a stunning political conspiracy that sweeps up Johnny and Elanor Iselin, and which only Bennett Marco can possibly stop.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbce705dd5dbeb26f59abe2dcc3922e86e4e7c0b","amp;dn":"The+Manchurian+Candidate.1962.DVDRip.11+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbce705dd5dbeb26f59abe2dcc3922e86e4e7c0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,206,112,93,213,219,235,38,245,154,190,45,204,57,34,232,110,78,124,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
