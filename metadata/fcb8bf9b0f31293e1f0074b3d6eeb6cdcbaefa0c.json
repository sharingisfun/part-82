An old, fun chess program that fancy\\'s itself to insult you all throughout the game.\n\nThis game will NOT work on 64 bit operating systems. Possibly will work vista/7 32 bit. Have not tried yet. Should work fine XP on 32 bit.\n\nThis game isn\\'t compatible on my new computer, but I\\'d thought I\\'d share it with other people with older computers still.\n\nDownload, run the setup file.\n\nEnjoy, comment, and please seed the amount downloaded.\n\nCheck out my other torrents!\n\nPIRATESHARK","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcb8bf9b0f31293e1f0074b3d6eeb6cdcbaefa0c","amp;dn":"Extreme+Chess+%28Simon+%26+Schuster%29+%5BPIRATESHARK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcb8bf9b0f31293e1f0074b3d6eeb6cdcbaefa0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,184,191,155,15,49,41,62,31,0,116,179,214,238,182,205,203,174,250,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
