She is the adopted African-American child of white Jewish lesbians. Her older brother is black and Puerto Rican and her younger brother is Korean. Though it may not look typical, AveryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s household is like most American homes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ until Avery writes to her birth mother and the response throws her into crisis. She struggles over her ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtrueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ identity, the circumstances of her adoption and her estrangement from black culture. Just when it seems as if her life is unraveling, Avery decides to pick up the pieces and make sense of her identity, with inspiring results. A co-production of ITVS in association with the National Black Programming Consortium and American Documentary/POV and the Diverse Voices Project, with major funding provided by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 819 MiB for 1h 26mn 27s 264ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 177 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 352 (1.773) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 133 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:663d90d581c47a8e88ad1dab4dd24d1f79eed3c7","amp;dn":"POV.S23E11.Off+and+Running.HDTV.XviD-Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"663d90d581c47a8e88ad1dab4dd24d1f79eed3c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,61,144,213,129,196,122,142,136,173,29,171,77,210,77,31,121,238,211,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
