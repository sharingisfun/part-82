Abrams\nCast: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Leonard Nimoy, Eric Bana, Bruce Greenwood\n\n.: Plot :.\nIn the year 2387, the galaxy is threatened by an unusually volatile supernova. Ambassador Spock pilots a ship carrying &quot;red matter&quot;, which will create an artificial black hole to consume the supernova. Before Spock completes his mission, the supernova destroys the planet Romulus. Captain Nero of the Romulan mining ship Narada attempts to exact revenge on Spock, whom he blames for the destruction of his homeworld and its inhabitants, including his wife and unborn child. Both ships, however, are pulled in to the black hole's event horizon and travel into the past.\nThe Narada arrives first, 154 years in the past. Its arrival is preceded by what looks like a lightning storm in space, which the Federation starship USS Kelvin investigates. Nero attacks the Kelvin, causing severe damage. Acting-Captain George Kirk orders an evacuation and stays behind to provide cover for the fleeing shuttlecraft, his pregnant wife among the passengers. George pilots the Kelvin into the Narada moments after his son James Tiberius Kirk is born. Spock arrives 25 years later, where he is captured by Nero and marooned on the planet Delta Vega so that he can witness the destruction of Vulcan, as retribution for Spock's failure to save Romulus.\nSpock, Scott, and Pavel Chekov devise a plan to ambush the Narada by dropping out of warp behind Saturn's moon Titan. Kirk and Spock beam aboard the Narada. While Kirk rescues Pike, Spock retakes the elder Spock's ship, destroys the drill and lures the Narada away from Earth before piloting a collision course. The Enterprise arrives and beams Kirk, Pike, and Spock away before the collision, which ignites the remaining red matter and creates a black hole within the Narada's superstructure. Kirk offers to help rescue Nero and his crew, but the Romulan refuses and the Narada is destroyed. The Enterprise escapes the same fate by ejecting and then igniting the ship's warp drive reactor cores, with the resulting explosion pushing them clear...\n\nRating: 8.2/10   133,418 votes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f7904c4ad17e0450b90b97aae98864dc35e5e29","amp;dn":"Star.Trek.2009.Blu-ray.720p.x264.HDBRiSe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f7904c4ad17e0450b90b97aae98864dc35e5e29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,121,4,196,173,23,224,69,11,144,185,122,174,152,134,77,195,94,94,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
