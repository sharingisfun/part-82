Based on a true story, Net Worth blows the lid off the image of the golden era of the National Hockey League, to reveal the bloody battles and hard knocks dealt to the players off the ice. It's the story of ruthless men who would destroy careers in order to hide the millions they were making from the sweat and toil of others and more than anything else, taking advantage of the players' love of the game. In this larger than life David and Goliath conflict, Ted Lindsay, Detroit Red Wings captain, takes on the powerbrokers of the NHL.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d93077a3f3f1b049fe814fa793ce60f786d90ed","amp;dn":"Networth+-+Hockey+movie+-+CBC.DVDR.ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d93077a3f3f1b049fe814fa793ce60f786d90ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,147,7,122,63,63,27,4,159,232,20,250,121,60,230,15,120,109,144,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
