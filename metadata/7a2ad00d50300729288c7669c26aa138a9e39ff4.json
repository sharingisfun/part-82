Virtual CD creates images of your optical \n\nmedia, so you can use them at any time without having the physical medium on hand. Your \n\ndata is available exactly as if the medium was in the drive, without the disadvantages \n\nattendant, for example, on network shares. The images created can be stored on a server to \n\nenable simultaneous access by multiple users. When creating an image, you have the option \n\nof selecting the level of compression and, if desired, even encryption. You get maximum \n\navailability of your data, while lost, damaged and stolen media become a thing of the past. \n\nWith a simple left click on the Virtual CD symbol you arrive at the program menu where you \n\ncan utilize all important Virtual CD functions. If you click on the symbol with the right \n\nmouse key, the drive menu opens. Here you can e.g. insert and eject images or insert blank \n\nCDs in the virtual burner.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a2ad00d50300729288c7669c26aa138a9e39ff4","amp;dn":"Virtual+CD+10.1.0.9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a2ad00d50300729288c7669c26aa138a9e39ff4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,42,208,13,80,48,7,41,40,140,118,105,194,106,161,56,169,227,159,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
