At the trial, he is sentenced to be electrocuted, but a bleeding heart liberal has the sentence commuted to a mental facility. Here, he will interact with other model prisoners and give talks at schools while he is being treated. The only problem is that Johnny, being a ex-special forces trainer, is coming to the prison to seek his own justice and that does not include rehabilitation.\n\n\nRuntime:\n92 min\nCountry:\nUSA\nLanguage:\nEnglish\nColor: Color \n\n\n\n\n\nTrorrent created by Z0b41 , don't forget to seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f349b860d617942ed16aaee8ea387d46a01deb76","amp;dn":"The+Expert+%5B1995%5D++jeff+speakman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f349b860d617942ed16aaee8ea387d46a01deb76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,73,184,96,214,23,148,46,209,106,174,232,234,56,125,70,160,29,235,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
