It\nwill carry the load of the house over the 16ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ft. opening that was made in the rear foundation\nwall. Because the site is so hard to access, general contractor Tom Silva uses a crane to lift it\nup and over the house and place it carefully on a temporary wall near the installation site.\nThen, host Kevin OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Connor and TomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s crew lend a hand installing it. Master carpenter Norm\nAbram meets with product specialist Bill Gaines to see the insulated concrete forms being\nused not only for the foundations, but also for the aboveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½grade walls on the new additions.\nInside, Kevin welcomes Chris Kimball from AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Test Kitchen, to help us understand the\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtime capsuleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of a kitchen that we have from 1940 and where the new design is headed for\nour homeowners in 2010. Back outside, the forms are complete and the concrete truck\narrives to pour the foundation and walls. At the end of the day, Tom and Kevin discuss how\nthe new lead laws affect interior work and how to properly test for it. Using proper\nprotocol, the kitchen is gutted and the wall to the dining room comes down.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09b94d46780e7899bdcccf268a25513ad0d57058","amp;dn":"This.Old.House-Auburndale.Project-S30E03.AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09b94d46780e7899bdcccf268a25513ad0d57058","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,185,77,70,120,14,120,153,189,204,207,38,138,37,81,58,208,213,112,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
