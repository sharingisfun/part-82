This album contains many remixes of his previous tracks, with the addition of violinist Hiroyuki Kato.\n\n\nThe tracks I personally enjoy the most from this album are: Sepia, Pure Ruby, IRiA, and Rose Quartz.\n\n\nSepia is my favorite track from the album, and has a great alternation between some amazing pad synths and piano solos.\nPure Ruby is fast-paced, relaxing, and very beautiful in its piano scales and violin solos.\nIRiA is highly uplifting and well-paced with a great set of piano chord arrangements.\nRose Quartz has a darker feel to it, and with some bizarre use of rapid-phasing synth-plucks, and some light bitcrushing, can really put my mind to rest.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nDisc 01\n01.
