Secretly, the duo were two of the best spies the CIA had ever known, until they fell in love on the job five years ago and retired. When fellow spy and good friend Leo Nash goes missing while on the trail of a Russian arms dealer, the Blooms are reinstated by boss and agency liaison, Carlton Shaw, to locate and rescue Nash. With assistance from resourceful CIA field agent Bill Hoyt, whose professional admiration for Steven isn't hard to miss, the pair is thrust back into the world of espionage, disguises and hand-to-hand combat. Following leads that take them to cities spanning the globe, Steven and Samantha quickly realize that perhaps this supercharged, undercover lifestyle provides exactly the kind of excitement and romance that their marriage has been missing.\n\n\n\n\n                                 ****EOD****\n\n                         Even Firefighters need Heroes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7a160948e694395d5f89f5c3b76c2cc1c85cb7d","amp;dn":"Undercovers..S01E01..Pilot....EoD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7a160948e694395d5f89f5c3b76c2cc1c85cb7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,161,96,148,142,105,67,149,213,248,159,92,59,118,194,204,28,133,203,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
