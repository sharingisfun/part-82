With the surge of interest in bossa nova and samba, PetersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interpretations of songs like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œManha de Carnaval,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow Insensitive,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMeditation,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSamba de OrfeoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ have stood up very well against similar jazz recordings of the mid-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“60s. PetersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSoulville SambaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has a gospel flavor, while his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSensitive SambaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is more laid-back; Vincent YoumansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ decades-old ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCariocaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ also fit in nicely. This is an enjoyable, if not essential, part of Oscar PetersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s considerable discography. The one mystery is why the credits and liner notes couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have been reproduced on a larger insert in order for them to be readable; this is one major drawback in shrinking the original LP jacket to CD size. ~ Ken Dryden, AMG\n\nAs far as other reviews.....who cares about packaging! Big deal it comes in a slit case, you're not going to listen to it. I'm a huge oscar peterson fan, and to see something like this come out from him is simply amazing. It's like finding a heavy metal cd played by garth brooks. Oscar Peterson shows his true talent by being able to completely change his style and incorporate his jazz skillz into some beautiful latin beats. I bought this as a gift, and have regreted not keeping it for myself. If you're looking for just jazz, pick another of oscar's cds. However, if you're looking for brazilian, latin beats with jazz piano influence, then this is your purchase. ~ Edmundo\n\nPersonnel:\nOscar Peterson (Piano) \nSam Jones (Double Bass) \nLouis Hayes (Drums) \nMarshall Thompson (Timbales) \nHarold Jones (Percussion) \nHenley Gibson (Conga)\n \nOscar Peterson - Soul EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol  Tracks:\n01  Mas Que Nada (Jorge Ben) 2:27 \n02  Manha de Carnaval (Luiz BonfÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡/Vinicius de Moraes) 3:45 \n03  Call Me (Tony Hatch) 5:19 \n04  How Intensitive (Vinicius de Moraes/Norman Gimbel/Antonio Carlos Jobim) 4:02 \n05  Carioca (Edward Eliscu/Gus Kahn/Vincent Youmans) 4:31 \n06  Soulville Samba (Oscar Peterson) 2:25 \n07  Amanha (Tomorrow) (Phil Bodner) 4:21 \n08  Meditation (Norman Gimbel/Antonio Carlos Jobim/Newton MendonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a) 4:15 \n09  Samba Sensitive (Oscar Peterson) 3:20 \n10  Samba de Orfeo (Luiz BonfÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡/Vinicius de Moraes) 3:51 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:759b6fcf040c7082530b9db9b6e35200cb3dc5ff","amp;dn":"Oscar+Peterson+-+Soul+Espa%C3%83%C2%B1ol+%281966%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"759b6fcf040c7082530b9db9b6e35200cb3dc5ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,155,111,207,4,12,112,130,83,11,157,185,182,227,82,0,203,61,197,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
