You can't expect\nanything less than spectacular when you have Kenny Barron and Brian Blade\nwatching your back, but this trio has apparently matured in the intervening two\nyears.\n\nThey dig deeply into Kitagawa's five originals as well as compositions by Wayne\nShorter, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins and Ornette Coleman. The interplay is\nsomewhat looser and there is more excitement in the air. Kitagawa's bass chops\nare on full display on &quot;Oleo,&quot; a duo treatment with Blade, and album highlight\n&quot;Lonely Woman&quot; where he shows off his awesome bowing skills.\n\nIf you liked the trio's Ancestry, you will love this 2005 recording. Engineer\nMike Marciano did an excellent job and the sound is nothing short of\namazing. When you listen to this album, you've got to crank up the volume!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47d4d8f5cfc08f671c8716ffbecaa84ed33dcf3a","amp;dn":"Kiyoshi+Kitagawa+-+Prayer+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47d4d8f5cfc08f671c8716ffbecaa84ed33dcf3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,212,216,245,207,192,143,103,28,135,22,255,190,202,168,78,211,61,207,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
