A mysterious plague has swept over the earth, transforming the majority of the world's population into vampires. Humans are now an endangered, second-class species - hunted to the brink of extinction and then farmed to feed the vampires need for blood. The remaining humans are now in hiding and as supplies run low, the terrifying consequences of vampire starvation are becoming more apparent - the normally civilised vampire population will turn into literal blood sucking monsters if a blood substitute is not found.\n\n\nThis is my first torrent so please seed !\nHope you enjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f79ffa0333d1c237cc91c87f3240387c5e7c43f","amp;dn":"Daybreakers%5B2009%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5D-KRMovies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f79ffa0333d1c237cc91c87f3240387c5e7c43f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,121,255,160,51,61,28,35,124,201,28,135,243,36,3,135,197,231,196,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
