After three release candidates, Linux Deepin 10.06 was announced today. It is based on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, and a fresh installation (instead of upgrade from version 9.12) is recommended for users. It supports installation from USB devices and thus one does not need to burn the released ISO image onto a CD. Major components include ibus-sunpinyin the whole-sentence-oriented Chinese input method, Linux kernel 2.6.32-23, Flash player 10.1.53.64, Xfce 4.6.2, OpenOffice.org 3.2.0, Firefox 3.6.6 and its plugins all of the latest versions. User-friendly improvements include automatic installation (one only needs to perform disk partition and user creation), faster boot-up, and graphical configurations for various network settings.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://linux.deepin.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://linux.deepin.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nmd5sum : eae7bc00eb65e182ad909591114076f0  Deepin-10.06.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb0a4b282f7ddb143c2b45c5702d4c53d96cbe99","amp;dn":"Deepin-10.06.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb0a4b282f7ddb143c2b45c5702d4c53d96cbe99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,10,75,40,47,125,219,20,60,43,69,197,112,45,76,83,217,108,190,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
