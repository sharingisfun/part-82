It is, on the one hand, a very personal effort, Mr. Hurwitz's four-hour poem to his wife and coworker, Peggy Lawson, who died in 1971. Mr. Hurwitz recites rhythmically on the soundtrack, invoking the things his wife cared about, capturing ''the particulars of the world she strode into, breathed, saw with her own eyes.''
