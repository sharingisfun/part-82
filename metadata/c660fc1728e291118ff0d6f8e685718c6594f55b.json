If they re-take the House, will things change in Washington?   Or are American elections more like the song by The Who: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Get Fooled Again?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The relevant lyric: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMeet the new boss, same as the old boss.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  Reason editor Matt Welch thinks so.\n\nRepublicans say they will shrink government and Democrats say they are &quot;pro-choice&quot; ... but those are myths. Under Reagan, Nixon, Bush, the size and cost of government grew. Karl Rove will join the program to defend Republicans. And while Democrats are &quot;pro-choice&quot; on abortion, they're anything but pro-choice when it comes to education, wages, and other policy areas. I'll confront Democratic strategist Joe Trippi about that.\n\nAuthor Angelo Codevilla argues that whoever gets elected will soon act like a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œruling classÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. They will just grow the government and take more of our money.  The public, he says, puts up with it, much like a frog will slowly boil if you it in gradually heated water.  WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have a frog and a pot of boiling water in studio.    Will the frog jump out?\n\nWatch Thursdays at 9 p.m. &amp; midnight, Fridays at 10 p.m., Saturdays at 9 p.m. &amp; 12 midnight, and Sunday at 10 p.m. (all times eastern).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c660fc1728e291118ff0d6f8e685718c6594f55b","amp;dn":"20101021-Stossel-%5BElection+Myths%5D-Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c660fc1728e291118ff0d6f8e685718c6594f55b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,96,252,23,40,226,145,17,143,240,214,248,230,133,113,140,101,148,245,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
