Perfect couple Steve and Kate Jones, and their gorgeous teen-aged children Jenn and Mick, are the envy of their posh, suburban neighborhood filled with McMansions and all the trappings of the upper middle class. Kate is the ultimate trend setter - beautiful, sexy, dressed head-to-toe in designer labels. Steve is the admired successful businessman who has it all: a gorgeous wife, big house and an endless supply of high-tech toys. Jenn and Mick rule their new school as they embody all that is hip and trendy - cool clothes, fast cars and the latest gadgets. But as the neighbors try to keep up with the Joneses, none are prepared for the truth about this all- too perfect family.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdbc1559a6f7789344ea823f1c4e2caed491d037","amp;dn":"The.Joneses.2009.LIMITED.DVDRip.XviD-AMIABLE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdbc1559a6f7789344ea823f1c4e2caed491d037","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,188,21,89,166,247,120,147,68,234,130,63,28,78,44,174,212,145,208,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
