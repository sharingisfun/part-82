A fusion of acoustic guitar and bass, electric keyboard and violin, pedal steel, drums, and passionate, drawling vocals, Sleeper Car lets each sound find its place in a rich tapestry of auditory stimulation. It's the kind of music that plays in the background during a cool summer boxcar ride from Detroit to Chicago to Oklahoma City. Assembled hodge-podge from a group of talented Chicago musicians, Sleeper Car gleans inspiration from Detroit Rock, Chicago Jazz, and a love of the American Folk tradition. \n\n1. Shy Me 3:26   \n2.
