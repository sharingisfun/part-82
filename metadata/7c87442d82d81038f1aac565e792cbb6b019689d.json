The existence of a \nsecret transport system allows Kales for the first time to     \nsearch for an exit from Rhem.                                  \n  \nYou will have to collect several parts of a key to allow you   \naccess to that transport system. Once again you are on your    \nown to explore this huge, fantastic world full of strange      \nvehicles and buildings, unknown mechanisms and machines,      \nsecret passages and doorways.
