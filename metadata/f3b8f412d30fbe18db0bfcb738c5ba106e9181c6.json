If you're new to these, try that show if you enjoyed this one.)\n\n-------\n[Excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]\n\n\nSeptember 23, 2010 11:43 AM UTC by John Stossel\nTonight's Show: Lawyers Win, You Lose? (FBN @ 9pm ET)\n\nTonight on Fox Business at 9pm ET, I'm surrounded by ... Lawyers. (This FBN show is separate from my Fox News special, &quot;The Battle for the Future&quot; which airs Saturday at 9pm ET.)\n\nLawyers should act as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfree market checkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on illegal activities.  Often government doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do that well. Government is clumsy and bureaucrats get corrupted and do favors for the politically connected.  In theory, lawyers are a supplement to Adam Smith's invisible hand. They're the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œinvisible fist.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ You behave badly, and the lawyers will pound on you.\n\nIn reality, their lawsuits hurt more people than they help.\n\nSuperlawyer Mark Lanier will be on the show to defend the lawyers. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s made a fortune going after companies the bought companies that produced Asbestos, and drug makers like Merck, the makers of Vioxx.  He won, and then lost, but even though the FDA says the benefits of Vioxx outweigh the risk, Merck wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sell the drug because of lawsuit fears. Vioxx is just one of the many things we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get because of lawsuit fears.\n\nI'll also report on class action lawsuits (Surprise! The lawyers get all the dough, while the &quot;victims&quot; often get coupons); the devastation lawsuits wreak on small business (remember the dry cleaner sued for $67 million for losing a pair of pants? The suit is still going on, and the owners had to close 2 of their 3 shops.); and whether the system used by the rest of the world could fix things. (YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be surprised at what Mark Lanier has to say about that.)\n\nThat's tonight on FBN @ 9pm ET.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3b8f412d30fbe18db0bfcb738c5ba106e9181c6","amp;dn":"20100923-Stossel-%5BThe+Trouble+with+Lawyers+2%5D.Fox+Business.CF.av","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3b8f412d30fbe18db0bfcb738c5ba106e9181c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,184,244,18,211,15,190,24,219,11,252,183,56,197,186,16,110,145,129,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
