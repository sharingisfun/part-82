It was released as a single in January 1983 and peaked at number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was ranked as the 92nd best hard rock song of all time by VH1.\n\nThe song was re-recorded for the music video game Rock Band and was released as Downloadable content.\n\nDawn Patrol is an album by Night Ranger released in 1982. The band was named Ranger during the recording of the album. The first issues of the album were printed and ready to be shipped when it was discovered that there was a country  band from California with the same name. The band decided to name themselves Night Ranger after the song that Blades had written for the album. The record company destroyed the copies with the band name Ranger.\n\nNight Ranger is an American  1980s rock band from San Francisco that gained significant popularity during the 80s and 90s with a series of successful albums and singles. The band's first five albums sold over 10 million copies worldwide, and gave the band international recognition. The quintet is perhaps best known for the power ballad &quot;Sister Christian&quot;, which peaked at #5 in June 1984.\n\nAfter their success waned in the late 1980s, the band split up in 1989 and its members pursued other musical endeavours including both group and solo efforts. Several members released an album without original singer Jack Blades in 1995, but the band soon re-united to release two new albums in the latter half of the decade. Despite the departure of original keyboardist Alan Fitzgerald and guitarist Jeff Watson, the band has continued to tour into 2008 and remains very popular in Asian countries including Japan.\n\nNight Ranger continues to play the summer festival circuit. In 1999 they joined other 1980s bands in the second installment of the Rock Never Stops Tour, which also happened to feature Ted Nugent.\n\nIn 2003, Alan Fitzgerald was replaced by Great White rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Michael Lardie. Fitzgerald handled offstage keyboards once again for Van Halen in 2004.\n\nIn 2007, while working on Hole in the Sun, Jeff Watson was fired from the band. His replacement for the remainder of the tour was Winger/Whitesnake guitarist Reb Beach. Lardie and Beach have currently left the band to focus on projects from Great White and Winger/Whitesnake. Joel Hoekstra has replaced Beach and Christian Matthew Cullen has replaced Lardie.\n\nIn January 2008, in a podcast interview with Stuck in the 80s, Jack Blades said the band's latest album -- Hole in the Sun -- would be released in April 2008 and will be supported by a national tour. In addition, Blades said the band was flying to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in late January to play a special show for the Navy and Marines troops on the island. To date Night Ranger have sold 16 million albums worldwide.\n\nHoekstra recently joined the band of the '80s rock musical Rock of Ages. Sister Christian is one of the songs in the show.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f205536dc7e5fb0f628d7d6b8e43a67d0e8133df","amp;dn":"Night+Ranger-Don%5C%27t+Tell+Me+You+Love+Me%28Live+From+NAAM%29%282nafis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f205536dc7e5fb0f628d7d6b8e43a67d0e8133df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,5,83,109,199,229,251,15,98,141,125,107,142,67,166,125,14,129,51,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
