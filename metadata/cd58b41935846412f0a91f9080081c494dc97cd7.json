The candidates seize the opportunity to impress Lord Sugar as they take over an industrial bakery. The teams are each given a market stall from which they try to tempt hungry customers with their baked goods, and they go head-to-head to pitch for the business of a high-class hotel, a restaurant and a coffee shop. Nick and Karren keep an eye on proceedings as the teams work to keep up with orders, and when the teams face Lord Sugar in the boardroom, one candidate is fired.\n\n\nAspect Ratio......: 16:9\nResolution: 832x468\nFPS.......: 25.000\nVideo Codec: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\nVideo Bitrate: 1500 kb/s\nLanguage: English.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd58b41935846412f0a91f9080081c494dc97cd7","amp;dn":"The+Apprentice+UK+S06E03+Bakery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd58b41935846412f0a91f9080081c494dc97cd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,88,180,25,53,132,100,18,240,169,31,144,128,8,28,73,77,201,124,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
