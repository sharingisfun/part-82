Some elements from Quantum of Solace were removed such as the cover to cover system. There are some driving sequences. Blood Stone features a unique Focus Aim system which allows players to lock onto targets after melee takedowns, not too dissimilar to the \\&quot;Mark and Execute\\&quot; feature from Splinter Cell Conviction. There is also a multiplayer mode consisting of up to 16 players that will pit spies versus mercenaries. Alongside team deathmatch and other standard game modes there are massive objective-based battles where players have to work as a team to attack or defend various spy-themed goals. It has also been announced that players will pilot a number of vehicle types throughout the course of the game.\n\nMinimum System Requirements - Please note that James Bond 007(TM) - Blood Stone does not support Microsoft(R) Windows(R) 2000.\n\n3D hardware accelerator card required - 100% DirectX(R) 9.0c-compliant 256 MB video card and drivers\nNVIDIA(R) GeForce(R) 7600 GT and better chipsets, ATI Radeon(TM) X1650 and better chipsets\nIntel(R) Core(TM) 2 Duo E4300 1.80 GHz or AMD Athlon(TM) 64 x2 4000+ 2.0 GHz or better\n12 GB of uncompressed hard disk space (plus 400 MB for the Windows(R) swap file and 2 MB free for saved games)\nDirectX(R) 9.0c (Included)\nEither a 100% Windows(R) XP-compatible computer system including:\nMicrosoft(R) Windows(R) XP\n1 GB of RAM (Windows(R) XP)\n100% DirectX(R) 9.0c-compliant true 16-bit sound card and drivers\n100% Windows(R) XP-compatible mouse, keyboard and drivers\n100% Windows(R) XP-compatible 6x speed DVD-ROM drive (600 K/sec sustained transfer rate) and drivers (*)\nOr a 100% Windows Vista(R) or Windows(R) 7-compatible computer system including:\nMicrosoft(R) Windows Vista(R) or Microsoft(R) Windows(R) 7\n2 GB of RAM (Windows Vista(R), Windows(R) 7)\n100% DirectX(R) 9.0c-compliant true 16-bit sound card and drivers\n100% Windows Vista(R) or Windows(R) 7-compatible mouse, keyboard and drivers\n100% Windows Vista(R) or Windows(R) 7-compatible 6x speed DVD-ROM drive (600 K/sec sustained transfer rate) and drivers (*)\nMotherboard integrated video chipsets not supported\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ... *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:425c3f31dd44f3738a65a9bdf0c013032e77b58f","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+JAMES+BOND+-+BLOOD+STONE+Full+Game+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"425c3f31dd44f3738a65a9bdf0c013032e77b58f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,92,63,49,221,68,243,115,138,101,169,189,240,192,19,3,46,119,181,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
