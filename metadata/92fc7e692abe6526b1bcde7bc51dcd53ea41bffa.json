No matter what changes a user makes to a workstation, simply restart to eradicate all changes and reset the computer to its original state - right down to the last byte. Expensive computer assets are kept running at 100% capacity and technical support time is reduced or eliminated completely. The result is consistent trouble-free computing on a truly protected and parallel network, completely free of harmful viruses and unwanted programs.\nWhile Deep Freeze provides bulletproof protection, its non-restrictive approach also improves user productivity and satisfaction. Placing no restrictions on a user's ability to access all system resources, users avoid the frustration of downtime due to software conflicts, operating system corruption, virus attacks, and many other problems. Users are always assured of computers that are consistently operable and available\n\nDeep Freeze Enterprise provides IT professionals with centralized deployment and flexible management control. The Enterprise Console allows IT Professionals to install, control, and manage Deep Freeze workstations. Deep Freeze also integrates with several third-party solutions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ visit our Integration Options page to learn more\n\n\n::: Key Features ::: \n\n- Absolute Protection \t  \t \n# Guaranteesworkstation recovery on restart \n\t\n# Provides password protection and complete security \n\t\n# Protects multiple hard drives and partitions \n\t\n \n- Integration and Compatibility \t  \t \n# Supports multi-boot environments \n\t\n# Compatible with Fast User Switching\n\n# Supports SCSI, ATA, SATA, and IDE hard drives \n\t\n# Single install for Windows 2000, XP, Vista and 7\n\t\n# Supports FAT, FAT32, NTFS, basic and dynamic disks \n\t\n# Localized in six languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Japanese &amp; Simplified Chinese\n\t\n \n- Deployment Options \t  \t \n# Offers silent install option for rapid network deployment \n\t\n# Provides option to deploy on multiple workstations as part of a master image\n\t\n# DFC included in Workstation/Seed installations\n\t  \n \n- Security and Control \t  \t \n# Encrypt all components with a unique Customization Code \n\t  \t\n# Preset multiple passwords to be used on a workstation or via the Command Line Control with varying activation and expiration dates \n\t  \t\n# Generate encrypted One Time or One Day Passwords \n\t  \t\n# Disable keyboard and mouse during maintenance periods or on demand\n\t  \t\n# Boot Control window provides ability for immediate reboot\n\t\t\n# Use Stealth Mode to hide the Deep Freeze system tray icon\n\t  \n \n- Configuration Options \t  \t \n# Create customized installation files using the Configuration Administrator \n\t  \t\n# Pre-select Frozen Drives and selectively Freeze or Thaw fixed drives \n\t  \t\n# Create customized Enterprise Consoles with tailored features and abilities\n\t\t\n# Schedule automatic Restart/Shutdown times\n\t  \t\n# Restart computer on Logoff\n\t  \t\n# Shutdown workstations after a preset length of inactivity \n\t  \t\n# Schedule Thawed Maintenance periods to perform Windows updates through the Internet or a SUS/WSUS server or run a custom batch file to update other software\n\t  \t\n# Schedule Send Message tasks\n\t  \t\n \n- Central Management \t\t\n# Schedule restart, shutdown, Wake-On-LAN, Freeze, Thaw and Thaw Locked tasks dynamically to take place once or on a regular basis\n\t\t\n# Scheduled tasks run even when the Enterprise Console is closed\n\t\t\n# Change maintenance and restart/shutdown schedules on the fly\n\t\t\n# Power-on workstations using Wake-On-LAN technology\n\t\t\n# Use Workstation Seed for workstation communication and installation\n\t\t\n# Manage workstations easily with User Defined Groups\n\t\t\n# Quickly populate multiple groups or sub-groups with smart automatic filters or import groups from Active Directory\n\t\t\n# Remotely deploy, execute, and control software on workstations\n\t\t\n# Invoke system maintenance on demand with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThaw LockedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ mode\n\t\t\n# Update all pre-existing installation files automatically\n\t\t\n# Launch RDP and VNC sessions through the Enterprise Console\n\t\t\n# With Faronics Core, keep scheduled actions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œactiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to ensure updates on offline workstations\n\t\t\n# With Faronics Core, manage workstations with dynamic groups, perform actions on workstation groups, view workstation activity status, and remotely wake-up offline workstations via the web\n\t\t\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã†â€™\n- Expanded Network Options \t\t\n# Communicate with workstations over a LAN, WAN, or combination\n\t\t\n# Create Remote and Multiple Consoles with the Deep Freeze Server Service Manager\n\t\t\n# Support for multiple ports for use with Server Service Manager\n\t\t\n# Preset passwords with activation and expiration dates\n\t\t\n# Instantly send notification messages to workstations\n\t\t\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã†â€™\n- Data Retention Options \t  \t \n# Create up to eight ThawSpaces on a workstation that can be used to store programs, save files, or make permanent changes\n\t  \t\n# Thawspaces can be visible or hidden\n\t  \n# Specify the size and file system of the ThawSpace (up to 1TB using NTFS)  \n\t  \t\n \n- Flexibility Options \t\t\n# Override ongoing maintenance periods\n\t\t\n# Display warning messages on workstations before events take place.
