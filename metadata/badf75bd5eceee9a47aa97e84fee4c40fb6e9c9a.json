This is all due to not having license to these songs. While this torrent does not restore the songs that have been edited out of each episode, it does restore the various slightly different intros to each episode back to the Billy Joel tune as was presented when the show was originally on TV.\n\nEnjoy. I know the show is much better with the original intro tune.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:badf75bd5eceee9a47aa97e84fee4c40fb6e9c9a","amp;dn":"Bosom+Buddies+%28Season+1%29%28DVDRip%29%28original+intros+restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"badf75bd5eceee9a47aa97e84fee4c40fb6e9c9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,223,117,189,94,206,238,154,71,170,151,232,79,238,76,64,251,110,156,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
