His driving vision was to capture fragments of actuality which, when organized together, showed a deeper truth which could not be seen with the naked eye. In the &quot;Kino-Pravda&quot; series, Vertov focused on everyday experiences, eschewing bourgeois concerns and filming marketplaces, bars, and schools instead, sometimes with a hidden camera, without asking permission first.\n\n\nSoviet peasantry, health resort of the Caucasus, horse race track\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nimdb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0953467/\nDirector: Dziga Vertov\nRuntime: 7 minutes\nSilent, URSS\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVHSRip\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Codec: XviD\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Bitrate: 4.234 Kbps\nResolution: 640 x 464 (Full Screen)\nFrame Rate: [/b]29.970 FPS\nSize: 226.2 Mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ef741be800d24cbe48cf6cc03d0200272a14176","amp;dn":"Kino_pravda_5_DzigaVertov_EnglishSubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ef741be800d24cbe48cf6cc03d0200272a14176","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,247,65,190,128,13,36,203,228,140,246,204,3,208,32,2,114,161,65,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
