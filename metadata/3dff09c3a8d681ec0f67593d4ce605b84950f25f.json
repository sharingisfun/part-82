To use it just copy 'seplugins' folder onto your Memory Stick and enable 'macrofire.prx' plugin in any convenient way. This way the UP ARROW will play red notes as it does in Rockband. And LEFT TRIGGER will function as UP ARROW. This achieved by binding Cross button functions to UP ARROW, so be aware of that. And don't forget to disable 'macrofire.prx' plugin while playing other games, cuz it will interfere with your regular game controls. \n\nDefault controls:\n\nLeft arrow: green notes\nUp arrow: yellow notes\nRight arrow: blue notes\nDown Arrow: red notes\n\nOR\n\nSquare: green notes\nTriangle: yellow notes\nCircle: blue notes\nCross: red notes\n\nAlternative controls (Rockband-style):\n\nLeft arrow: green notes\nUp arrow: red notes\nTriangle: yellow notes\nCircle: blue notes\n\nSome screens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img651.imageshack.us/img651/8207/20101005103736.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img651.imageshack.us/img651/8207/20101005103736.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img408.imageshack.us/img408/981/20101005103928.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img408.imageshack.us/img408/981/20101005103928.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracklist included in respective file.\n\nAnd remember these files are for the custom firmwares ONLY!\n\nEnjoy &amp; Have fun! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dff09c3a8d681ec0f67593d4ce605b84950f25f","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5DGuitarway+to+Heaven+4+-+Amplified%5BENG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dff09c3a8d681ec0f67593d4ce605b84950f25f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,255,9,195,168,214,129,236,15,103,89,61,76,230,5,184,73,80,242,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
