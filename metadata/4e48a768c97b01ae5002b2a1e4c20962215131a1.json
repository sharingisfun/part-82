Backed by a small but exemplary supporting cast including guitarist Chuck Wayne and reedist Jerome Richardson, Kenney eschews embellishment and excess in favor of lean, taut arrangements that emphasize emotional contextÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½her readings of familiar songs like &quot;More Than You Know&quot; and &quot;A Sunday Kind of Love&quot; possess a startling intimacy.\n\n\nwith artwork\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e48a768c97b01ae5002b2a1e4c20962215131a1","amp;dn":"%28Vocal+Jazz%29+Beverly+Kennet+-+Like+Yesterday+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e48a768c97b01ae5002b2a1e4c20962215131a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,72,167,104,201,123,1,174,80,2,178,161,228,194,9,98,33,81,49,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
