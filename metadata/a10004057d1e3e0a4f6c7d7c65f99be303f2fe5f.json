The main character, Jenny, is a recent graduate of the University of Chicago, who moves to Los Angeles to live with her boyfriend Tim and begin a professional writing career. Jenny's life is turned upside down when she attends a party hosted by Tim's next-door neighbors, Bette and Tina, a lesbian couple who are about to take the step into parenthood after being together for seven years. A brief encounter at the party with Marina, the owner of the local coffeehouse, suddenly has Jenny thrust into a whole new world that makes her question her own sexual orientation. Other friends of Bette and Tina include Dana, a professional tennis player who is shy but eager to meet the right woman; Alice, a magazine writer who has a brief relationship with a self-identified &quot;lesbian&quot; man; and Shane, a hairstylist who can't stick to just one woman, and Kit, Bette's half sister who struggles with alcoholism.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a10004057d1e3e0a4f6c7d7c65f99be303f2fe5f","amp;dn":"The+L+Word+s01e01-03+%5BXviD+-+Ita+Ac3+Eng+Mp3%5D+%5BTNT+Village%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a10004057d1e3e0a4f6c7d7c65f99be303f2fe5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,0,4,5,125,30,62,10,79,108,125,124,101,249,155,227,3,242,254,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
