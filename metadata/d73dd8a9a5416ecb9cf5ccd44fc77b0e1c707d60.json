You would be surprised at how many useless files might be laying around on your hard disks. The files and folders are automatically sorted by size, with the biggest sizes first.\n\nWhile the app is measuring a folder the user can browse the files within that folder and immediately see the size in bytes. Hidden files, cache files, directories will all show up with their corresponding size.\nOnce the measuring of a folder has ended the user can also view the information by filtering for particular file sizes or types. The user can also move unwanted files and folders in the corresponding Trash bin similar to the FinderÃƒÂ¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d73dd8a9a5416ecb9cf5ccd44fc77b0e1c707d60","amp;dn":"WhatSize+4.9.6+%2B+CORE+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d73dd8a9a5416ecb9cf5ccd44fc77b0e1c707d60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,61,216,169,165,65,110,203,156,245,204,212,79,199,123,14,28,112,125,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
