There are relatively few products available in shops or on the Internet which offer even close to 100% protection against any malicious programs via USB drive. The majority of products are unable even to guarantee 90% protection. USB Disk Security is the world's best software to block threats via USB drive.\n\n&gt;&gt; The best solution to protect offline computer\n\nOther antivirus software should update signature database regularly, and they cannot effectively protect offline computer that is not connected to the Internet. When new viruses, worms and other malicious attacks strike, traditional signatures are insufficient. Every minute one waits for a virus signature update creates a window of vulnerability that could have devastating consequences. USB Disk Security uses advanced proactive detection techniques, requires no signature updates, and closes the window of vulnerability left open by other reactive, signature-based responses.\n\n&gt;&gt; The world's fastest and smallest antivirus software\n\nWith USB Disk Security, itÃƒÂ¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:318d8700d985b9c013a2eb6e13bcce80335748c5","amp;dn":"USB+Disk+Security+5.4.0.2+%2BSerial-%5BHB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"318d8700d985b9c013a2eb6e13bcce80335748c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,141,135,0,217,133,185,192,19,162,235,110,19,188,206,128,51,87,72,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
