OSU scored a touchdown in that time period. This is from a Tivo HD signal, but when I tried to get it to the hard drive of the computer it only recorded it in SD 720x480. I have never been able to get a Tivo into the computer without it being 720x480. Also the Columbus Dispatch for the week.  GO BUCKS!!!!! DECLAW THE BOBCATS!!!!!!  Enjoy and please share. Question, comments,suggestions, and complaints always welcome. Once again, sorry about the mmissing 3 min. of Quarter 2.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2102ef1095ee92a23ccdfe0b99f6c4a531596e8","amp;dn":"OSU+Miami_9-11-2010_First_Half","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2102ef1095ee92a23ccdfe0b99f6c4a531596e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,16,46,241,9,94,233,42,35,204,223,224,185,159,108,74,83,21,150,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
