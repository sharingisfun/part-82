Style comes in a close second to speed, and Juiced offers thousands of real-time modding combinations that empower players to create their ultimate personality-infused street machines. But it takes more than a fresh coat of pearlescent paint to earn respect on the road; it takes the ball bearings to go up against the trash-talking, nitrous- burning faithful who want to strip everyone of their cash, cars and pride. Juiced lets players connect with their community and share the high-octane action by recruiting drivers to become part of their crew and race together as a team to put the brakes on the competition. Features more than 50 licensed vehicles, including Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Dodge, Ford, Mazda Mitsubishi, Pontiac, Holden, Volkswagen, Fiat, Renault, Subaru, Peugeot and Chevrolet; Hundreds of authentic aftermarket parts from leading manufacturers such as A'PEXi, AEM, Bridgestone, Ferodo, Konig, Alpine and HKS that provide players with thousands of personalized vehicle customization combinations; Progressive, non-linear gameplay that enables players to build their characters and cars, and gain respect and notoriety by winning races and cash; Unique blending of simulation and the high-octane appeal of arcade-style racing; Ability to build custom racing crews that work together as a team to win races; Authentic car physics and damage; and Online head-to-head play.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nMINIMUM\n933Mhz CPU\nDirectx 9.0c or better\n3D accelerated DirectX9c compatible video card\nNVIDIA GeForce2 or better\nATI 8500 32 MB or better\nIntel 915G integrated graphics or better\nMatrox Parhelia\n256 Megabytes of RAM\n2.6 GB free hard drive space\n(additional space required for Windows swap-file and\nDirectX 9.0c installation)\n8x CD-ROM drive\nDirectx 9.0c Compatible Sound Card\nMS compatible mouse\nKeyboard\n\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\n2.8 Ghz CPU\nDirectx 9.0c or better\n3D accelerated GeForceFX 6800, ATI Radeon 9800 or better DirectX9 compatible video card\n512 Megabytes of RAM\n2.6 GB free hard drive space\n(additional space required for Windows swap-file and\nDirectX 9.0c installation)\n16x CD-ROM drive\nDirectx 9.0c Compatible Sound Card\nMS compatible mouse\nKeyboard\n\nIt is very important that you install the latest drivers\nfor your card before running Juiced as\nthere are known problems with older drivers.\n\nInstructions:\n1)Run Install_Juiced Batch file\n2)Play with Juiced.exe\n\nNOTE: IF YOU GET AN ERROR THAT SAYS '' Juiced Requires virtual memory to be enabled.''
