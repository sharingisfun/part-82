It is a parody retelling the events of the Watergate scandal which ended the presidency of Richard (&quot;Tricky Dick&quot;) Nixon and features several cast members from Saturday Night Live.\n\nKirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams star as Betsy and Arlene, two warm-hearted but not very bright 15-year-old girls and inseparable best friends who, through various twists and turns, become the legendary 'Deep Throat' figure partly responsible for bringing down the presidency of Richard Nixon. Dan Hedaya plays Nixon. His associates H. R. Haldeman, G. Gordon Liddy, John Dean, Henry Kissinger and secretary Rose Mary Woods are respectively played by Dave Foley, Harry Shearer, Jim Breuer, Saul Rubinek and Ana Gasteyer. Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein are played by Will Ferrell and Bruce McCulloch. Teri Garr appears as Arlene's mother.\n\nDirected by\tAndrew Fleming\nProduced by\tGale Ann Hurd\nWritten by\tAndrew Fleming\nSheryl Longin\nStarring\tKirsten Dunst\nMichelle Williams\nDan Hedaya\nMusic by\tJohn Debney\nCinematography\tAlexander Gruszynski\nEditing by\tMia Goldman\nDistributed by\tColumbia Pictures\nRelease date(s)\tAugust 4, 1999\nRunning time\t94 min.\nCountry\tFrance\nCanada\nUnited States\nLanguage\tEnglish\nBudget\t$13,000,000\nGross revenue\t$23,230,123\n\n\n\nCast\n\nKirsten Dunst - Betsy Jobs\nMichelle Williams - Arlene Lorenzo\nDan Hedaya - President Richard M.
