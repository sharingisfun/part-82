It's a place where rape has become a weapon of war. Now a BBC film crew follows Judith Wanga as she meets the survivors of the conflict. She talks to women, children, and child soldiers who've been forced to kill so that they themselves will not be killed. To her horror, she discovers that the violence is fuelled, in part, by the need to mine the minerals that go into the manufacture of mobile phones and laptops.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d9ba15ea424826677adcfa0efc1b552eea51ffd","amp;dn":"Four.Corners.2010.07.26.Heart.of.Darkness.WS.H264.ACC.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d9ba15ea424826677adcfa0efc1b552eea51ffd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,155,161,94,164,36,130,102,119,173,207,160,239,193,181,82,238,165,31,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
