The series resembles Dancing with the Stars, but in this case the women are famous figure skaters and the men are well-known hockey players.\n\nIf you are a fan of figure skating, ice hockey or Dancing With The Stars, this show is worth a try.\n\nThe 5 remaining pairs are:\n- Patrice Brisebois and Shae-Lynn Bourne\n- Kelly Chase and Kyoko Ina\n- Todd Warriner and Isabelle Brasseur\n- Valeri Bure and Ekaterina Gordeeva\n- Theo Fleury and Jamie SalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©\n\nTwo of the judges are the same each week: Sandra Bezik and Jeremy Roenick. The guest judge this week is Scott Hamilton.\n\nThe hosts are Kurt Browning and Ron MacLean.\n\n\nThe resolution is 624x352 and is 21:15 long. While the video quality isn't awesome, it is quite watchable in my opinion This episode aired on CBC on Oct 25, 2010. \n\nCBC has a big website for this show at http://www.cbc.ca/battle/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb7a3d5d928670ecb1bc67346af33571d2d65035","amp;dn":"Battle.of.the.Blades.S02E08.WS.XviD-err0001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb7a3d5d928670ecb1bc67346af33571d2d65035","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,122,61,93,146,134,112,236,177,188,103,52,106,243,53,113,210,214,80,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
