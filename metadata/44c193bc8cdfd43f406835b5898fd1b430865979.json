Major influences included Procol Harum and The Left Banke. They are best known for their 1971 hit &quot;Mammy Blue&quot;, referring to a son's poignant song addressed to his departed mother about his childhood memories and life in general, sometimes spelled &quot;Mommy Blue&quot; or &quot;Mamy Blue&quot;, or misspelled as &quot;Mummy Blue&quot;, which was a Top 10 hit throughout much of Europe, Japan (#2), and Canada (#42), and a minor Billboard Hot 100 chart hit in the United States (#57) as well. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. It was covered by many singers.The most famous recordings are the ones by Roger Whittaker, Horace Andy, Demis Roussos, Stories and  Oak Island Treasury Department.

In 1972, Mouth &amp; MacNeal reached the top of the charts throughout Continental Europe and Scandinavia. &quot;How Do You Do&quot; was made popular in the United States by radio personality Jim Connors and the song eventually reached #8 in the U.S. in July 1972. &quot;How Do You Do&quot; spent 19 weeks in the Billboard Hot 100 and won the R.I.A.A. gold disc on 2 August 1972. Selling over a million copies in the U.S. alone, global sales exceeded two million. This propelled their 1972 album &quot;How Do You Do&quot; into the Billboard 200 (US #77). More hit singles followed in 1973, and in 1974 Mouth &amp; MacNeal represented the Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest placing third, behind ABBA and Gigliola Cinquetti with their song &quot;I See a Star&quot;, which went on to be a #1 hit in Ireland.
