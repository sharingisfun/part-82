Now the video had several issues... main thing the colour is fooked, way to strong and sometimes too much yellow, then green, then red :lol: it was all over the place, so fixed it the best we could. Now also whilst syncing we found several spots that skipped video... so we worked it out to be around 30 secs roughly of missing video but apart from the big jump at the intro the rest was like 2-4 secs here and there,which made it harder to sync. The audio was our own line but not the best we've had... had some loud buzzing in the background. So we synced the audio up first to the video and then we dropped it in adobe audition and ran some noise/hiss reductions over it... tried to filter the worse parts more but you'll he a drop in the audio now and again. Anyway done the best we could folks... can't do any better :P\n\nOh also forgot to say, the source files is cropped badly across the bottom and left hand side... the AR slightly changes aswell due to some camera movement but you can hardly tell as it was only a few pixel top and bottom we had too crop.\n\ncredit IMAGiNE &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, IPTORRENTS, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic, FASAMOO, W1CK3D1NT3Z, GRIND3R, extremezone, MonsterTV, BLaZE, SAFCuk009, Fabreezy, MXMG, Hellb0y, iwanttobelieveinaj, velvetfog, mustaphanaru &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/wall%20st/vlcsnap-113981.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/wall%20st/vlcsnap-113981.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/wall%20st/vlcsnap-114297.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/wall%20st/vlcsnap-114297.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/wall%20st/vlcsnap-115393.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/wall%20st/vlcsnap-115393.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/wall%20st/vlcsnap-115967.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/wall%20st/vlcsnap-115967.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/wall%20st/vlcsnap-129276.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/wall%20st/vlcsnap-129276.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDON'T THANK US...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1027718/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1027718/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d02099dc7666bc809dbe8b3ffca03526f89e65e1","amp;dn":"Wall+Street+2+Money+Never+Sleeps+TS+XViD+-+IMAGiNE%28READ+NOTES%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d02099dc7666bc809dbe8b3ffca03526f89e65e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,32,153,220,118,102,188,128,157,190,139,63,252,160,53,38,248,158,101,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
