Many of the tracks on Revolver are marked by an electric guitar-rock sound, in contrast with their previous, folk rock inspired Rubber Soul. It reached number one on both the British chart and American chart and stayed at the top spot for seven weeks and six weeks, respectively.\nThe album was released before their last tour in August 1966, but they did not perform songs from the album live. Their reasoning for this was that many of the tracks on the album, such as &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, were too complex to perform with live instruments.[1] They toured with &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; as their only new song from 1966, which was not on the album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e4d8cbc5265246cbee76c3f2640931365415da3","amp;dn":"7%2F14+Revolver+%282009+Stereo+Remaster%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e4d8cbc5265246cbee76c3f2640931365415da3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,77,140,188,82,101,36,108,190,231,108,63,38,64,147,19,101,65,93,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
