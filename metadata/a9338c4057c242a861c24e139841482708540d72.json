Mainly acoustic and featuring a lot of good harmonic singing. This album does not enjoy a great deal of my attention, but it's nice music with a kind of sunday morning mood about it. \n\nKey Tracks: Full Of Stars.\n                   Pain Killer.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9338c4057c242a861c24e139841482708540d72","amp;dn":"Turin+Brakes...Ether+Song%282003%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9338c4057c242a861c24e139841482708540d72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,51,140,64,87,194,66,168,97,194,78,19,152,65,72,39,8,84,13,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
