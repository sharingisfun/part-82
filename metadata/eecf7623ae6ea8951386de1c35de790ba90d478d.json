Still a good J-Core album by all regards, it has less success than 1,2, and 4. More emphasis on the speedcore and gabber, which can be niche tastes.\n\nThe two big hits:\nNo Reason (Trance) - Joshka. Ranked right next to Serotonin 2008 (from Hardcore Syndrome 2) on last.fm, his other big hit.\nIrrelevance (Gabber) - USAO. This may be my favorite gabber track, from all of gabber. It ranks around fourth on USAO\\'s last.fm playcounts.\n\n01. No Reason - Joshka\n02. Remm - REDALiCE \n03. Drome (DJ Shimamura\\'s 09 Update) - DJ Shimamura \n04. Stasis - Minamotoya Feat Motoko\n05. Syndrome of The Strange Country\\'s Alice - REDALiCE vs DJ Technorch\n06. Tc-ma_011 - DJ Technetium\n07. Division 4 - Betwixt &amp; Between\n08.
