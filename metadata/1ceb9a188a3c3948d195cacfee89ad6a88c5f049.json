If you find the sound of a fortepiano too 'twangy', and if you believe that scores are cast in stone and not to be improvised around, look away now.\n\nHowever, if you are as impressed as I am with Andreas Staier's artistry and integrity, and if you enjoy hearing familiar repertory presented in a fresh and enterprising way you'll be delighted and amazed with these three sonatas, played on a copy of a fortepiano from 1785.\n\nStaier breathes new life into these sonatas through a combination of stunning virtuosity and a keen sense of adventure. These are not lightweight or trivial interpretations; he does not decorate or improvise merely for effect. These are fresh and vital performances that challenge perceptions about how instrumental works by Mozart and his contemporaries should be performed. I would recommend this disc to anyone.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ceb9a188a3c3948d195cacfee89ad6a88c5f049","amp;dn":"Mozart+-+Piano+sonatas+K330%2C+K331+%5C%27alla+turca%5C%27%2C+K332+-+Andreas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ceb9a188a3c3948d195cacfee89ad6a88c5f049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,235,154,24,138,60,57,72,209,149,202,207,238,137,173,106,136,197,240,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
