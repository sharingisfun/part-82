For starters, most of the staff can't square up to the job. They're suffering the torments of unrequited love - for each other... \n\nTicket-inspector Robin's marriage has fallen apart and, in a horribly doomed last-ditch scramble, he's staking all on Nadine, the restaurant-car chef who is scarcely aware Robin exists. Nadine is besotted with rogue-ish buffet-car manager Carl, who is completely in love with himself. Robin, in turn, ignores the forlorn flirtations from dippy trolley-attendant Carol.\n\n\n\n1: Why does an intercity journey turn into an emotional rollercoaster? Because the train staff have to battle with their thwarted infatuations - for each other. And those toughies in the wedding carriage aren't helping matters.\n\n2: The 9.27 London to Exeter emotional rollercoaster continues as the staff's personal embroilments deepen, and a member of a wedding party joins in the melee. And why are there fingerholes in the muffins?\n\n3: Love flourishes among the staff on the 9.27 London to Exeter, but with the unwelcome addition of Diana's amorous mum. And why's her dad squashing Carol's muffins?\n\n4: After delays caused by lightning, a 20-piece orchestra practices in Coach G. This offers Robin a plangent background for his declaration of love - but can he seize his chance?\n\n\nCast:\nRobin ...... Jeremy Swift\nNadine ...... Alex Kelly\nPeter ......
