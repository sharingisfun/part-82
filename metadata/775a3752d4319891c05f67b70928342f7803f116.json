Republicans now hold more state legislative seats than they have since 1928 after winning 600 state legislative races, 19 legislative chambers, and 21 governor's seats. These gains will have a big impact when state lawmakers begin to decide how to redraw the district boundaries for the U.S. House of Representatives. To explain these changes, we are joined by Michael McDonald, a redistricting expert at George Mason University.\n\n\n- As Right-Leaning &quot;Blue Dogs&quot; Lose Seats, Democrats' Progressive Caucus Increases Plurality in Next Congress\n\nThe Democrats lost the House in Tuesday's midterms but what is the makeup of the new Democratic House caucus? The conservative Blue Dogs lost half their members while the Progressive Caucus remains near 80. We speak to its co-chair, Rep. Raul Grijalva, who appears to have retained his Arizona seat. Over the past year Grijalva has received numerous security threats, including having a suspicious package covered in swastikas sent to his office and having a bullet shot through his district office in Yuma.\n\n\n- After Midterm Gains, How Will GOP Run the House?\n\nThe GOP takeover of the House means a new lineup of committee chairs, who have significant influence over the laws that get passed. The new chairs are expected to have a crucial impact on legislation relating to the budget and spending, defense, foreign policy, healthcare, energy, and immigration. We look at how the GOP plans to wield power in Congress with Huffington Post correspondent Ryan Grim and Rep. Raul Grijalva.\n\n\n- &quot;Children of the Exodus&quot;: Surge of Deportations Endangers Abandoned Migrant Mexican Youth\n\nA new investigation published in The Texas Observer looks into one aspect of the collateral damage of our current immigration laws that result in tens of thousands of unaccompanied migrant children being deported to Mexico every year. Many of these children are abandoned on the streets of Mexican border cities and end up in shelters in areas that have been ravaged by escalating drug violence.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:775a3752d4319891c05f67b70928342f7803f116","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+04+nov+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"775a3752d4319891c05f67b70928342f7803f116","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,90,55,82,212,49,152,145,192,95,103,183,9,40,52,47,120,3,241,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
