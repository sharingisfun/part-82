We visit some \n       incredible flying penguins and other elegant Manta Ray-inspired \n       robots at Festo in Germany and visit Malawi, where scientists are \n       studying the intricate structures of termite mounds to create \n       self-cooling houses of the future.\n       \n       In Holland we meet the brilliant sculptor Theo Jansen as he shows \n       us his latest amazing contraption, the Animaris Siamesis - a huge \n       insect-like structure that moves independently and gracefully with \n       the wind. In Israel, Jem Stansfield meets a man who has invented a \n       fish-like 'gill' which could allow humans to breathe underwater \n       and we look at some weird and wonderful fly-eating furniture based \n       on the Venus Fly Trap plant and other carnivorous plants. Finally, \n       Wallace, with the help of his friend Goronwy, gives us a run-down \n       of his top five animal-inspired inventions.\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e2a48d908187a28a97918acc838b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de5103b9a652e0e2894d717242c5bee758a999e0","amp;dn":"Wallace.And.Gromits.World.Of.Invention.S01E01.HDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de5103b9a652e0e2894d717242c5bee758a999e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,81,3,185,166,82,224,226,137,77,113,114,66,197,190,231,88,169,153,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
