But the murder squad she takes over is hostile to her, the men upstairs are eager to pull the plug on her investigation, her personal relationships suffer from her obsession with work, and the prime suspect remains elusive. Jane has her work cut out for her as she and her team work their way through computer data trails, legwork, intuitive leaps, chases, arrests, and confessions to find the killer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c174f76752aa72e7df0f38586865a591bc9b66a9","amp;dn":"Prime.Suspect.1.1991.DVDRip.XviD-AnDrOiD.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c174f76752aa72e7df0f38586865a591bc9b66a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,116,247,103,82,170,114,231,223,15,56,88,104,101,165,145,188,155,102,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
