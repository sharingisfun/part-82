In 2002, Finkel, a rising star at the Times, was fired for fabricating a character in a story about child laborers in Africa. Just as the story of his downfall was about to become public, he learned that a man named Christian Longo, arrested in Mexico for the murder of his wife and three small children in Oregon, had been living under an assumed identity: Michael Finkel of The New York Times. Sensing a story--and an opportunity for redemption--Finkel contacted Longo, initiating a relationship that would grow increasingly complex over the course of Longo's trial and conviction.\n\nFinkel makes no excuses for his actions. Nor does he deny his own narcissism--a narcissism that allowed him to rationalize his own lies as surely as Longo rationalized his crimes. Ultimately, Finkel says, his year with Longo taught him &quot;how a person's life could spiral completely out of control; how one could get lost in a haze of dishonesty; and how these things could have dire consequences.&quot; The lesson, Finkel need not add, applies as much to the disgraced writer as it does to the killer.\n\nFormat: M4B\nSize: 146 MB\n\n--------------------------------------\nVisit us for this and loads more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.com\n---------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc3d46fa9419c98860f95b224aaad7ca70d8cbd2","amp;dn":"True+Story%3A+Murder%2C+Memoir%2C+Mea+Culpa+-+Michael+Finkel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc3d46fa9419c98860f95b224aaad7ca70d8cbd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,61,70,250,148,25,201,136,96,249,91,34,74,170,215,202,112,216,203,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
