On the CD Lee sings 3 songs and Danny sings 1 while the rest of the vocals are done by guest vocalists: Tim Polecat, Jamie James and Claudia Cummings. Also appearing on the CD are guest musicians Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter  (guitar and Pedal Steel), Adrian Demain (guitar), Chris Mostert (Sax) and Mark Ritter (Piano &amp; vibes). Released early 1999.\n\nAlthough many songs on the CD are from the Swing era, the performances have a strong Rockabilly/Jump Blues influence (definitely a great dance record). \n\n\n    Genre: Rockabilly/Swing/Jump Blues\n\n    Track Listing:\n\n    1.
