Though Let It Be was the last album released before The Beatles' dissolution in 1970, work on Abbey Road began in April 1969, making it the final album recorded by the band. Abbey Road was released on 26 September 1969 in the United Kingdom, and 1 October 1969 in the United States. It was produced and orchestrated by George Martin for Apple Records. Geoff Emerick was engineer, Alan Parsons was assistant engineer, and Tony Banks was tape operator.\n\nAbbey Road is regarded as one of The Beatles' most tightly constructed albums, although the band was barely operating as a functioning unit at the time.[1][2] Rolling Stone placed it at number 14 on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2009, readers of the magazine also named Abbey Road the greatest Beatles album","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:942ea063eb242390af0427a82bd2f24cef9cf76e","amp;dn":"12%2F13+Abbey+Road+%282009+Stereo+Remaster%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"942ea063eb242390af0427a82bd2f24cef9cf76e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,46,160,99,235,36,35,144,175,4,39,168,43,210,242,76,239,156,247,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
