Hmm OK then shall we try another? Well they did. And then another and then some more and well OK there you go it started to come together. They played some songs, some people clapped, some cried, some told them to Fuck Off! But they kept on playing, making some noise over there in the corner. They recorded a few songs and stuck 'em online and got some more gigs. So there you go. Two men. One called Lee. Another called Lee. One plays guitar. The other plays bass. They both make noises with their mouths. Sometimes together. Sometimes alone. But always out of time and out of tune. Just as good fucking punk rock should be. Especially The Lees kind.\n\nwww.the-lees.co.cc\n\nThis is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License enabling you to share and share alike.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:704a1beaa9cce97f3ffac63e19c772bea2ac7793","amp;dn":"The+Lees+-+Demo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"704a1beaa9cce97f3ffac63e19c772bea2ac7793","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,74,27,234,169,204,233,127,63,250,198,62,25,199,114,190,162,172,119,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
