Now the discovery and growing awareness of neuroplasticity has revolutionized our understanding of the brain ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and has opened the door to new treatments and potential cures for many diseases and disorders once thought incurable.\n\nNeuroscience is past viewing the human brain as a machine, as it once did, where, if one part breaks down or doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t work properly, the function it performed is permanently gone, in all cases. Indeed, in just the past few years, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve built on our knowledge that our brains are constantly changing their structure and function and that the adult brain is not ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhard-wiredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but plastic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ always changing. It applies even in old age ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a particularly hopeful note for an aging population like ours.\n\nChanging Your Mind follows last seasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eye-opening documentary The Brain That Changes Itself (based on the best-selling book by Toronto psychiatrist and researcher Dr. Norman Doidge).  Once again, Dr. Doidge takes us through some very compelling neurological cases to illustrate how the changing brain plays an important role in treating mental diseases and disorders. \n\nIn Changing Your Mind, we explore the latest research that is offering hope to those suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and even schizophrenia.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 419 MiB for 44mn 59s 699ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 160 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 352 (1.773) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 129 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebecf25a28783fee7469f4577688296b51dca75d","amp;dn":"The+Nature+of+Things.S50E02.30.Sep.2010.HDTV.XviD-Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebecf25a28783fee7469f4577688296b51dca75d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,236,242,90,40,120,63,238,116,105,244,87,118,136,41,107,81,220,167,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
