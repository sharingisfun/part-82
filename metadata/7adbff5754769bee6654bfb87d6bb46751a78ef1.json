This intriguing documentary series explores \nthe ambitious effort to compile, transcribe, edit and present the papers \nof, by, and directly related to the LDS Prophet Joseph Smith.  In this \nseries, Larry H. Miller and KJZZ Television have partnered with the \nChurch History Department and a variety of prominent scholars to discuss \nthe project, the documents, and the life and work of Joseph Smith.  \n\nThese video files were ripped from the 6-disc DVD set.  The discs \ncontained no additional bonus features nor subtitles, or I would have \nincluded them as well.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\t\t\tNOTES\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the Joseph Smith Papers Project itself:\n\nThe Joseph Smith Papers (or Joseph Smith Papers Project) is a project \nresearching, collecting, and publishing all manuscripts and documents \ncreated by or sent to Joseph Smith, Jr.(1805-1844), the founder and \nfirst prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS \nChurch).\n\nThey will present the earliest handwritten and published texts of the\nfoundational documents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day \nSaints, including Joseph SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s revelations and translations. The \nPapers will provide insights into JosephÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life and times through his \ncorrespondence, journals, discourses, court cases, and business \ndealings. In addition, the Papers will contain minutes of important \nchurch councils, reproductions of the scriptural canon as it existed \nduring Joseph SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lifetime, official histories, and records \npertaining to church institutions that were under Joseph SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \ndirection or that reflect his personal instruction and involvement.\n\nWith the PapersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ publication, readers will have, for the first time \nin one place, access to these essential primary documents. To date, \nthere never has been a complete listing, let alone a comprehensive \nedition, of Joseph Smith's papers. This ambitious project is intended \nto fill that gap. \n\nAlthough not an official part of the project, a documentary TV series \nalso called The Joseph Smith Papers was created. This series \ndocumented the creation of and work involved in the Joseph Smith \nPapers Project. It was produced by KJZZ-TV in cooperation with the \nLDS Church Historical Department.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7adbff5754769bee6654bfb87d6bb46751a78ef1","amp;dn":"Joseph+Smith+Papers+-+Complete+Season+2+-+LDS+Mormon+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7adbff5754769bee6654bfb87d6bb46751a78ef1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,219,255,87,84,118,155,238,102,84,191,184,125,107,180,103,81,167,142,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
