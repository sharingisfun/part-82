It was a spoof of police dramas, packed with visual gags and non sequiturs. While a parody of many television shows and movies, it bore a particular resemblance to the Lee Marvin cop show, M Squad (especially the opening credits).[2] Although canceled after only six episodes, it spawned the successful Naked Gun movie trilogy.\n\nPolice Squad! was created by the comedy filmmaking trio Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker, who had previously worked together on The Kentucky Fried Movie and Airplane!. Despite critical acclaim, the show was cancelled by ABC after just six episodes.[3] This was enough to gain a strong cult following through repeat broadcasts,[4] which led to the 1988 film version The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! and two further sequels. Many gags from the show were recycled for the films.\n\nLeslie Nielsen played a role that was written especially for him,[5] as Detective Frank Drebin in the series and all three films. Alan North played the role of Captain Ed Hocken on the show; in the films, the role was played by George Kennedy. Peter Lupus co-starred as Officer Norberg (in the films, O.J. Simpson appeared as the similarly named Officer Nordberg). Ed Williams, who played scientist Ted Olson on the show, would reprise his role in the films, making him and Nielsen the only two actors from the series to appear in the movies. Robert Goulet, who appeared as one of the &quot;special guest stars&quot; who were invariably killed off at the beginning of their episodes, would appear as villain Quentin Hapsburg in the second Naked Gun film. Dr. Joyce Brothers played herself in The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! She played herself in Episode 4 of the television series.[6]\n\nThe show was presented in the style of a Quinn Martin show of the early 1970s,[7] with a portentous narrative over the opening titles which made a big feature of the show being &quot;...in color&quot; (a common real-life feature in opening credits and promos of TV shows in the 1960s, before color broadcasting became the norm), followed by numerous gags. Each episode would similarly play credits over a 1970s style freeze frame of the final scene, except that the frame was not frozen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the actors simply stood motionless in position while other activities (pouring coffee, convicts escaping, chimpanzees running amok) continued around them.\n\nOne noticeable difference between the series and the films is in the portrayal of Frank Drebin. In the series he is shown to be considerably more competent and strait-laced, and less Maxwell Smart-like than he is depicted in the films. The TV portrayal of Drebin was never intended to be overtly comic, merely a send-up of the ultra-serious Dragnet-like portrayal of TV cops, the kind of role Nielsen himself had played straight in the QM Production The New Breed and in The Protectors segment of The Bold Ones. In the series, Drebin was intended to be the archetype of the straight man, in contrast to the rampant hilarity going on around him. It was not until the films that Drebin was changed to a more outwardly comic character\n\nMain cast\nDrebin, Norberg and Hocken, The main characters of Police Squad!\n\n    * Leslie Nielsen - Detective Frank Drebin\n    * Alan North - Captain Ed Hocken\n    * Peter Lupus - Officer Norberg\n    * Ed Williams - Ted Olson, Scientist\n    * William Duell - Johnny the Snitch\n    * Ronald &quot;Tiny Ron&quot; Taylor - Al\n\nOf the main cast, Nielsen, Williams and Taylor were the only ones who returned and were portrayed by the same actors in The Naked Gun film series.\n[edit] Guest stars\n\nDuring the opening credits of each episode, a well-known actor is introduced as a &quot;special guest star&quot;, but then meets a grisly death during the introduction,[3] thus completing their appearance on the show. Stars (along with their fates) included:\n\n   1. Lorne Greene (stabbed and thrown from a speeding car)\n   2. Georg Stanford Brown (crushed by a falling safe)\n   3. Robert Goulet (executed by firing squad)\n   4. William Shatner (dodges a salvo of bullets but drinks poisoned wine)\n   5. Florence Henderson (gunned down while singing in a kitchen)\n   6. William Conrad (stabbed and thrown from a speeding car)\n\nA sequence was filmed with John Belushi (chained to concrete blocks underwater) but the actor died shortly before the episode was due to air, and the producers decided not to use the scene. According to the Internet Movie Database the producers wanted to include the Belushi scene when Police Squad was rebroadcast in the 1990s, but the footage could not be located and is presumed lost.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4256b0bc5113acf73f2e5080f2c09588e41acbb6","amp;dn":"Police+Squad%21+%281982+TV+Comedy+NTSC+DVD5+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4256b0bc5113acf73f2e5080f2c09588e41acbb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,86,176,188,81,19,172,247,63,46,80,128,242,192,149,136,228,26,203,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
