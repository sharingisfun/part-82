Starring Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter.\n\n----\nTwo dopey dudes are failing in school, a visitor appears to help them out. A most excellent adventure follows thereafter! Dude, I'd put more for the synopsis, but it'd ruin the whole film. ;)\n\nENJOY!!!\n\nP.S:\n\nTo EASILY put on a DVD:\n\n1. download a free video converter \n(http://download.cnet.com/Free-Video-Converter/3000-2194_4-75024034.html)\n\n   -Don't trust the &quot;does not work&quot; comments. Once downloaded, go on 'Video Info' and\n    set the year date to '1987' or something. It's what I did to beat the pop up that \n    says &quot;Invalid Date&quot; or some shit. :)\n\n\n2. open up file once downloaded, and convert to DVD Format.\n\n3. once converted it's as simple as using Windows Movie Maker to make a dvd.\n\n4.  Enjoy your bodacious copy of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, dudes! ~~~MM\n\n\nP.P.S:\n\nPlease comment on how it works!!! MY FIRST TORRENT! :O\nI hope the instructions are clear.\n ~~~Party on, dudes! :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32660547646ffee4623a3ceac1580b92ff5f423d","amp;dn":"Bill+and+Ted%5C%27s+Excellent+Adventure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32660547646ffee4623a3ceac1580b92ff5f423d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,102,5,71,100,111,254,228,98,58,60,234,193,88,11,146,255,95,66,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
