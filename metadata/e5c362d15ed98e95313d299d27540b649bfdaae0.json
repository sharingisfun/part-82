The album marked a startling change in the band's sound, shifting from radio-friendly pop rock to garage rock, comparable to the sound of The Strokes.\n\nDuring the recording of the album, drummer and co-founder Jason Schwartzman left the band to pursue his acting career.\n\nThe song &quot;By the Bed&quot; is about Alex's grandmother, and what she told him on her deathbed.\n\nThe music video for album's single, &quot;Big Brat,&quot; had significant airplay beginning in December 2003. It cuts between scenes of an urban performance of the song to the band shooting a low budget zombie film in the relative location.\n\nThe actual zombie film being shot was used as an alternate music video for the song available to fans on the bands website","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5c362d15ed98e95313d299d27540b649bfdaae0","amp;dn":"Phantom+Planet+-+Phantom+Planet+%5B2004%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5c362d15ed98e95313d299d27540b649bfdaae0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,195,98,209,94,217,142,149,49,61,41,157,39,84,11,100,155,253,170,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
