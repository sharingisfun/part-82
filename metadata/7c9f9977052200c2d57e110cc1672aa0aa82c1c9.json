These &quot;rar&quot; &quot;files&quot; are the safest way to download from public trackers especially if there is a &quot;sfv&quot; and an &quot;nfo&quot; file included as that indicates the release is good, while i understand that &quot;rar&quot; files double the hard drive space needed to unpack and of course seed is not an option for some of you guys, but safety is the way to go in my opinion, anyways all the words i have quoted &quot;quote&quot; please google them , then you will be better informed.\n\n\nIf You need more help understanding the scene Google it :) \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   nfo\n\nAs the evidence mounts against David, any hopes of clearing his name are dashed when Graeme regains consciousness and warns him he will go down for his actions. Jason finds himself in the spotlight after he drives Rosie to an underwear photoshoot, and Ashley tries to make sure there will be no move to France. Kylie announces she is taking Max on holiday, and Carla invites Michelle to work with her as a PA\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c9f9977052200c2d57e110cc1672aa0aa82c1c9","amp;dn":"Coronation.Street.21st.October.2010.WS.PDTV.XviD-BX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c9f9977052200c2d57e110cc1672aa0aa82c1c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,159,153,119,5,34,0,194,213,126,17,12,193,103,42,160,170,130,193,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
