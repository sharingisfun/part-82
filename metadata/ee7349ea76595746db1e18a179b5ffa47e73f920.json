This situation irks the gang, but especially Leonard as Sheldon's roommate, since they all detest Amy, who they consider sanctimonious and condescending. The gang's problem may self destruct when sanctimonious and condescending Amy has a fundamental disagreement with sanctimonious and condescending Sheldon, leading to the two deciding to break-up despite not having been boyfriend/girlfriend. Sheldon states that he is perfectly fine with the relationship ending, but his actions seem to imply otherwise as he replaces Amy with something else in his life. Concerned for his friend's state of mind, Leonard calls in the one person who he believes can get through to Sheldon.
