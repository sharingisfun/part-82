Using the latest science,       \n         NGC constructs a 3-D state-of-the-art CGI model of our        \n         galaxy. We'll peer into the heart of the Milky Way on the     \n         hunt for super-massive black holes, watch how stars are       \n         born and die, fly out and above the plane of our galaxy       \n         to understand its true shape and scour its dusty spiral       \n          arms for the possibility of life.                             \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n         Hybrid. About 90% video which is all the CGI. The live        \n         human footage is film. I did a low threshold blend on the     \n         film parts to get it to a smoother video rate. I left alone   \n          the awesome graphic parts.
