Happily, the tape was rolling and this superb\nCD is the result. The aptly named trio features tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby\nand drummer Tom Rainey. Helias pilots the group with a selfless spirit; his\ncompositions walk a fine line between structure and freedom and any of the three\ninstruments can take the lead or recede into the background at any\ntime. Lurching unpredictably between stirring cacophony and wily precision, Open\nLoose rewrites the rules of jazz trio interaction even as they summon a sound\nrooted in jazz tradition. Highlights include the driving quasi-funk of &quot;Mapa,&quot;\nthe unison themes and frequent tempo shifts of &quot;Startle&quot; and &quot;Pick and Roll,&quot;\nand the moody ballad &quot;Gentle Ben.&quot;\n\nMore reviews: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.markhelias.com/rlpressNS.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.markhelias.com/rlpressNS.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3973ced67a6473c6f2c6e7b9047ee08968e5148a","amp;dn":"Mark+Helias%5C%27+Open+Loose+-+New+School+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3973ced67a6473c6f2c6e7b9047ee08968e5148a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,115,206,214,122,100,115,198,242,198,231,185,4,126,224,137,104,229,20,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
