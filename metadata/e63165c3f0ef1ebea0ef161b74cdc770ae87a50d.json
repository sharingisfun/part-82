When her agent and best friend Julia (Stockard Channing) arranges for her to accept a lucrative contract with a Boston ad agency, Natalie discovers that she will be working for her own gay brother Roy (Kiefer Sutherland), whom she hasn't seen in a decade. Although Roy is insufferably snobbish and manipulative, he manages to exert a curious control over Natalie, forcing her to confront several disturbing, long-suppressed memories of her past (shown in black-and-white flashbacks). Before the film is over, Natalie is made to realize why Roy's behavior is so overbearing -- and also, the viewer learns just how intimately Julia is involved in the lives of both siblings. Underwritten by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation as part of an ongoing program to heighten HIV/AIDS awareness, Behind the Red Door made its Showtime cable-network bow on January 12, 2003\n\n\nTheatrical Feature Running Time:\n    105 mins \n\nComplete Cast of Behind the Red Door\n\n    * Kyra Sedgwick - Natalie Haddad\n    * Stockard Channing - Julia\n    * Chuck Shamata - Father\n    * Corey Staden - Young Roy\n    * Laura Press - Michelle\n    * William Colgate - Dr. Goldberg\n    * Mary Walsh - Anna\n    * Matt Sharpe - George\n    * Peter Rompkey - Carl\n    * Mack Barfoot - Maitre D'\n    * Kay Annonsen - Head Nurse\n    * Andrew Vokey - Orderly\n    * Berni Stapleton - Mother\n    * Doreen Reardigan - Aunt Mae\n    * Jody Richardson - Alan\n\n    * Kiefer Sutherland - Roy Haddad\n    * Jason Carter - Sonny\n    * Hannah Lochner - Young Natalie\n    * Philip Craig - Det.
