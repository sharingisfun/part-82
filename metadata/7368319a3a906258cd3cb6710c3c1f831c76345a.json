Fritz look for hidden memorabilia by digging\n\t\tthrough junk piles, abandoned barns and neglected garages. This\n\t\tseries follows Mike and Frank through small towns and back roads\n\t\tfor a glimpse at this little-known side of the antiques business.\n\t\tWhether tracking down a one-of-a-kind Ferris wheel or sizing up a\n\t\tvintage Harley-Davidson, they must be prepared to verify an\n\t\tobject's history and judge its value. The pressure mounts as they\n\t\tstrike the ultimate deal, find just the right buyer and turn\n\t\taround the item fast. Sometimes they make a buck; and sometimes\n\t\tthey walk away with little more than the history of an item. \n\n     \n                                           \n                EPISODE SUMMARY                  \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n        Episode 01x11 - Fill'er Up (Apr/05/2010)\n\n          A collector in Georgia has a shed packed with curios \n\t\t  and movie memorabilia from his family's drive-in theater; \n\t\t  vehicle collection in Florida; property with tractors, \n\t\t  signs and an outbuilding full of treasures\n\n     \n                                           \n                   RIP NOTES                     \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                                   Enjoy!\n\n     \n                                           \n               GROUP INFORMATION                 \n        9 Years of the Force and still         \n                     going strong                      \n     \n\n        What we are looking for:\n\n        * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n        * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n        * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage\n\n        * Also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n        * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs.\n        * Winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n        * dont forget to tag your work\n\n        * If you think you can help contact us on irc,\n        * or email us on &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;73351c011016331b06001b5d121a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7368319a3a906258cd3cb6710c3c1f831c76345a","amp;dn":"American.Pickers.S01E11.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7368319a3a906258cd3cb6710c3c1f831c76345a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,104,49,154,58,144,98,88,205,60,182,113,12,60,31,131,28,118,52,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
