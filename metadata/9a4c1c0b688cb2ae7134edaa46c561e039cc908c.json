Jayne had once robbed the boss with a partner but barely escaped by jettisoning from their getaway vehicle his partner (now waiting for revenge) and the money boxes (who have made him a legendary hero). Jayne is recognized by all and &quot;welcomed&quot; accordingly. Sub-plots show Simon and Kaylee face their growing romantic feelings, River first tries to &quot;fix&quot; the Bible and is later traumatized by seeing Book's hair. Meanwhile, Inara is &quot;making a man of&quot; the magistrate's resentful son who helps the crew escape out of spite to his father. But there has been a confrontation with Jayne's abandoned partner whose vengeful shotgun kills one of Jayne's young hero-worshipers, bringing Jayne to verge of philosophy with Mal. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Season 1, Episode 5: Out of Gas\n\nWhen Serenity's life support system fails, Mal orders the crew off the ship - but he stays behind. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Season 1, Episode 6: Shindig\n\nAfter scuffling with one of Inara's clients during a royal ball where the Serenity crew is hired by a diplomat to smuggle some unusual cargo, Mal is challenged to a duel of swords by the snobbish and arrogant royal Atherton Wing. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Season 1, Episode 7: Safe\n\nWhile visiting an outlying planet, Simon and River are kidnapped by local villagers in need of a doctor.
