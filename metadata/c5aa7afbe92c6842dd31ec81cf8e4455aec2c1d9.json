Lassiter quickly thinks that the widow (Jean Smart) is responsible, but Shawn and Gus believe that the victim was trained to be a con artist, by the guy (John Michael Higgins) who they think is the actual murderer. Shawn takes a different approach than usual to figure it out, but the case takes a turn for him. Also guest stars Lee Garlington.
