A         \n    French gangster has moved into Frankie's territory, so Frankie flies     \n    home to take care of business. He promptly has himself arrested so       \n    that he'll have the perfect alibi when his top local associate dies,     \n    but then Frankie's life gets complicated: his enemies have enough        \n    juice to keep him in prison for awhile, his associates and allies are    \n    killed one at a time, and attempts on his life start. Help comes from    \n    an unlikely source: Tony Breda, a wannabe wiseguy who's a Milanese       \n    raised in Hoboken. Tony designs a plan to spring Frankie from jail,      \n    and then all roads lead to Marseilles. Is Tony a future Mafia don?       \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
