Pierre is a free-lance journalist hired to write the script; he's short of time so he asks a Bohemian poet friend, Paul, to help. Pierre wants facts and tracks down Rosemonde for interviews that lead to other explorations; Paul only wants to imagine her and needs little more than her name to do so. But he does meet her, and she entangles him, too. Did she cause the shooting? Is she venomous or innocent? - Imdb\n\n\nEnglish subs: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/pt/subtitles/3710057/salamandre-la-en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/pt/subtitles/3710057/salamandre-la-en&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nGerman Subs:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/lasalamandre-01.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/lasalamandre-01.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/lasalamandre-02.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/lasalamandre-02.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/lasalamandre-03.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/lasalamandre-03.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/lasalamandre-04.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/lasalamandre-04.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDVD Rip\n696x416\nContainer: AVI\nVideo Codec: DX50\nVideo Bitrate: 1702 Kbps\nAudio Codec: MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 320\nAspect Ratio: 1.673\nFrame Rate: 25.000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:077fa5482e1fb1364a1c6d94f4e5ec484e5d458b","amp;dn":"Alain+Tanner+-+La+Salamandre+%281971%29+aka+The+Salamander","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"077fa5482e1fb1364a1c6d94f4e5ec484e5d458b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,127,165,72,46,31,177,54,74,28,109,148,244,229,236,72,78,93,69,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
