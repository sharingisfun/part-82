The master pianist and his backing group take the stage here at the Rockpalast in 1990, performing a set which includes such hits as &quot;Jacob's Ladder,&quot; &quot;Mandolin Rain,&quot; and the chart topping &quot;The Way It Is.&quot; Hornsby beautifully demonstrates both his vocal range and his impeccable piano stylings, while the Range provide a full yet unobtrusive supporting sound.\n\n\nSize: 6.12 Gb ( 6 420 348 KBytes ) - DVD-9\nEnabled regions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\nPlay Length: 70 minutes\nVideo: PAL 4:3 (720x576) VBR\nAudio: English (Dolby AC3, 2 ch), English (Dolby AC3, 6 ch)\nMenu Video:\nPAL 4:3 (720x576) VBR\nMenu Subtitles:\nNot specified\nMenu English Language Unit :\nRoot Menu\n\n\n01.
