The album is a far from perfect record. &quot;Don't Drink The Water&quot; and &quot;Sweet River&quot; are full of pops and scratches from poor recording and the levels of both songs are off quite a bit. Though the album does contain the myspace hit &quot;The Surf&quot; and the sludgy ambient title track &quot;Blood In The Water.&quot; A first recording but it set the grounds for every record to follow.\n\nGuitar- Whitey Quick\nVocals- Dom Zombie\n\nTracklisting:\n1. Don't Drink The Water (Intro)\n2. The Surf\n3. Sweet River\n4.
