A team of Los Angeles FBI agents, led by Stanford Wedeck (Vance) and spearheaded by Mark Benford (Fiennes) and his partner Demetri Noh (Cho), begin the process of determining what happened, why, and whether it will happen again. Benford contributes a unique perspective on the investigation; in his flashforward, he saw the results of six months of investigation that he had done on the flashforward event, and he and his team use those clues to recreate the investigation.\n\nThe team investigates a number of events related to the flashforward, including &quot;Suspect Zero&quot;, who did not lose consciousness during the event because of a Quantum entanglement device (QED), the sinister &quot;D. Gibbons/Dyson Frost&quot;, and a similar mass loss of consciousness in Somalia in 1991. Meanwhile, personal revelations contained within the flashforwards occupy the personal lives of the principal characters. Mark Benford sees himself relapsing into alcoholism; his wife sees herself with another man; Demetri Noh sees nothing, which could mean that he will not be alive to see the day everyone else has glimpsed or, perhaps, that his future wasn't set on the day of the flashforward. Other characters grapple with similarly unexpected or surprising revelations in their flashforwards.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3890f44a166d6e41d13f36f387a20b5665c2a5e6","amp;dn":"Flash.Forward.S01.Complete.TeaM+RCP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3890f44a166d6e41d13f36f387a20b5665c2a5e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,144,244,74,22,109,110,65,209,63,54,243,135,162,11,86,101,194,165,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
