In a barbaric environment where bio fuel, batteries, bullets and people are currency and marauders roam free, Wes tries to escape to a mythical world run on cold fusion &quot;Plutopia&quot;, a place that may only exist in the mind. THE BILL IS DUE. 'Downstream' is a view of the not so distant future. We follow a young man (everyone's son) as he pays the price for society's decadence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2daa1a10bc67a8f9ab3be2576384e2d9d84d14ca","amp;dn":"Downstream.2010.BDRip.XviD-BRiGHT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2daa1a10bc67a8f9ab3be2576384e2d9d84d14ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,170,26,16,188,103,168,249,171,59,226,87,99,132,226,217,216,77,20,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
