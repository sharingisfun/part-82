It does, especially when you are about to explode. One day, returning from a business trip has been a failure, known at the airport to a man who is presented as a friend and benefactor, and encouraged him to change his life, to be free. It is not a simple invitation, this guy I besiege to the absolute limits to achieve its purpose. Since then, the life of Edward begins to slide into ambiguous territory where the certainties are fading, and running becomes useless.
