If you're struggling, that shouldn't be a surprise, because other than Love and Death on Long Island, you'd be hard pressed to find anything credible on his resume. That's why Coldblooded, completely buried by the distribution company and eventually released direct to video, is a stunning surprise. Writer/director Wally Wolodarsky, who honed his craft writing for Tracey Ullman and The Simpsons, throws together another in the long line of awkward 90's crime comedy, but this time considerably darker. Priestley plays the role of Cosmo, an assistant to a bookie who is literally promoted to hitman, in a completely deadpan fashion, devoid of feeling or expression, slumped over with bad posture and nary any life experience or brain cells, and uncomfortable with anything out of his routine (which includes sex with his bored prostitute/friend, played by Janeane Garofalo) at odds with the pretty boy narcissism he became famous for. Though he isn't interested in killing anyone, his boss, Robert Loggia, forces him to go forward into training with veteran killer Peter &quot;Pickleman&quot; Riegert, eliminating gambling deadbeats (celebrity cameos abound) and other foes. As he gains more experience, he increases his confidence which includes a possible love interest/yoga teacher and a crisis of conscience resulting in just about the least predictable and blackest conclusion you could picture. Most of the movie is humorous and violent, but the ending is so perfect, ballsy, and potentially offensive that it redeems any qualms you might have had about the previous 90 minutes (of which I had none). When you're finished watching it, try to imagine the next 5 minutes of the character's lives. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/9205/94591793.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/9205/94591793.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img168.imageshack.us/img168/2305/29224972.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img168.imageshack.us/img168/2305/29224972.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img3.imageshack.us/img3/9795/98811146.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img3.imageshack.us/img3/9795/98811146.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n--------not my rip-------\n\n~~~~~~ Coldblooded.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n\n                                                               \n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................732,932,096                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \n\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:32:53                \n\nFrame Count:....................................167010             \n\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................592                  \n\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................320                  \n\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.850                     \n\nFrames Per Second:..............................29.970          \n\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................924                 \n\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \n\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.163&quot;                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \n\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \n\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................114                 \n\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR            \n\nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\n *****************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
