Earlier this month, Shourd was released on &quot;humanitarian grounds&quot; on $500,000 bail, but Iran is continuing to hold Bauer and Fattal. Sarah Shourd joins us today to discuss her time in solitary confinement, her political activism, how they were detained, her engagement to Bauer, and why she opposes a US attack on Iran. &quot;I'd really like to thank people and ask them to now slow down, to wait and put my freedom on pause and wait with me, so we can all enjoy it together once Shane and Josh are with me,&quot; Shourd said.\n\n\n- Appalachia Rising: 100 Arrested At White House Calling For End To Mountaintop Coal Removal\n\nOver 100 people were arrested outside the White House on Monday in a protest calling for the abolition of mountaintop removal coal mining. The rally was part of Appalachia Rising, a multi-day event organized by residents of Appalachian communities impacted by mountaintop removal. The protesters were detained after refusing to leave the sidewalk outside the White House fence. The NASA climatologist James Hansen was among those arrested. We speak to journalist and cultural historian Jeff Biggers.\n\n\n- As Settlement Construction Begins Again in the West Bank, Israel Blocks Jewish Activists on Aid Boat Headed to Gaza\n\nIsraeli commandos have boarded and seized a Gaza-bound aid ship of Jewish activists just miles off the Gaza coast. The activists were attempting to deliver a symbolic load of medicine, a water-purifying kit and other humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. The Jewish Boat to Gaza was the latest attempt to break the blockade since Israel's deadly attack on an aid flotilla in May. In the West Bank, Jewish settlers resumed building settlements on Monday one day after Israel refused to extend its partial freeze on settlement expansion.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ead336e69ce8ccd455a9d0e50a74c7e378750b3e","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+28+sep+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ead336e69ce8ccd455a9d0e50a74c7e378750b3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,211,54,230,156,232,204,212,85,169,208,229,10,116,199,227,120,117,11,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
