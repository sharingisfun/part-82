My source was the 1080p release by NLUPPER located here:  thepiratebay.se/torrent/5834437/Ondine_(2009)_1080P_X264_MKV_AC3_DTS_NLSub.\nIt fits nicely on one single-layer DVD.\n\nI maintained the DTS audio and washed the video through a x264 encoder a few times to maintain the best 720p quality.  I synced and included English subtitles, in case some Yanks have trouble with the Irish accents.  I also include synced Polish subtitles for the Alicja Bachleda fans.\n\nComments appreciated.\n\nPlease seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2c580c0ddf3d990c39fb2a120315b3ec68660d0","amp;dn":"Ondine.720.x264.DTS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2c580c0ddf3d990c39fb2a120315b3ec68660d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,197,128,192,221,243,217,144,195,159,178,161,32,49,91,62,198,134,96,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
