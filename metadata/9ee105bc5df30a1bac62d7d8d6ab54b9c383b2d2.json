The  band  was\n founded  in  1989, and was  active  throughout  the  1990s. Common\n themes in FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼vous songs include Canada and the &quot;human experience&quot;.\n\n The band  formed in 1989 when  Jian  Ghomeshi  (then going by Jean\n Ghomeshi), Murray Foster  and  Mike Ford, former classmates at the\n local Thornlea  Secondary  School and playing in a pub band called\n The Chia Pets at the time, joined with David Matheson to  busk  in\n Toronto. They drew  unusually  large  crowds, and, eventually, the\n attention of  Toronto-based  CBC  Radio, which commissioned  songs\n about political and local issues for the radio show Later the Same\n Day. Some songs  written  for the  show  later  appeared  on their\n albums; these songs include &quot;The Gulf War Song&quot; and &quot;My Baby Loves\n a Bunch of Authors&quot;, which was  written  for  a  Toronto  authors'\n festival.\n\n They cut a six-song demo tape in 1992, and their first major-label\n album, Bargainville, was released the next year. Its single, &quot;King\n of Spain&quot;, was only the second Canadian  independent #1 hit in the\n country's  history. (Torontonians Barenaked Ladies were first by a\n few months, with  1991's  &quot;Be My Yoko Ono&quot;.) Shortly  after,  they\n embarked on a touring schedule that continued, practically without\n stopping except to record new material, until the end of 2000.\n\n The band sometimes sang with little or no accompaniment in a style\n similar to contemporary a cappella. A number of their  songs  also\n express the band's progressive  political  leanings (&quot;The Greatest\n Man in America&quot;, for instance, harps on  Rush  Limbaugh,  and &quot;Big\n Fish&quot;  lambastes  former Premier of Ontario Mike  Harris). FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼vous\n was also known for their  close  relationship  with their fans and\n their  live  shows,  which  were  full  of  political  commentary,\n humorous banter, and musical improvisation.\n\n The band gave its last  concert in 2000 (excepting performances at\n annual fan conventions in 2001 and 2002).&quot;\n\n -- Wikipedia, &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxy_Fr%C3%BCvous&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxy_Fr%C3%BCvous&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n----------------------------[ L i n k s ]-----------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy (EAC) - A high-quality audio ripper.\n[ &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/&lt;/a&gt;  ]\n\nFree Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) - An extremely efficient and\ncomprehensively supported lossless audio format.\n[ &lt;a href=&quot; http://flac.sourceforge.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://flac.sourceforge.net/&lt;/a&gt;  ]\n\nFoobar2000 - An advanced and highly customisable freeware audio\nplayer.
