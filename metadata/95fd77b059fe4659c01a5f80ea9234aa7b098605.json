Unlike the sirens, however, they sing not to lure men to destruction but to detail the wrecking of their own hearts. Whether it's Young musing on duplicitous relationships (Watchman) or brooding on how she would spoon with an ex (The Shape We Made), or Slade struggling to forget the smell of a former lover by slinking downtown, where &quot;I see your face in everyone&quot;, the two women appear horribly bruised by love. This could make for a miserable album, and it does slide into morosity in its middle section.
