We assume those are not meant to be subbed as they are not meant to be understood. It seems the blu-ray lacks subs either as the rip of that one didn't pre with any subs either. See Sample dir for some proofs.\n\nYou may notice there was an internal of this movie a few weeks back from the mighty reencoding/p2p sourced grp RUBY. That was internaled due to foreign overlays that were present in the spanish scene dvdr they ripped off.\n\ncredit NODLABS &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, extremezone, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic, FASAMOO, W1CK3D1NT3Z, GRIND3R, extremezone, MonsterTV &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img811/7545/vlcsnap2010072423h28m43.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img811/7545/vlcsnap2010072423h28m43.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img507/730/vlcsnap2010072423h29m25.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img507/730/vlcsnap2010072423h29m25.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/1357/vlcsnap2010072423h28m51.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img832.imageshack.us/img832/1357/vlcsnap2010072423h28m51.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDON'T THANK ME...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8833d001c0334cc9e72d940c9c5628012aecac4a","amp;dn":"Triage.2009.FESTiVAL.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8833d001c0334cc9e72d940c9c5628012aecac4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,51,208,1,192,51,76,201,231,45,148,12,156,86,40,1,42,236,172,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
