Includes all teasers and songs released as of 26. August 2010. They are my own encodings, I used official website andto rip these songs. Some of the Teasers have been slightly EQ'ed, but I don't think you will notice. As for the full songs - they are the exact same copies (though re-encoded) that you will find on Limp Bizkit official website. I hope you will enjoy this torrent and help me seed. I made this because I didn't saw a proper torrent with all of the Gold Cobra goodies. \n\nAnd also, I included an extra - a quite high resolution cover of the album! I hope you will enjoy the artwork. Now sit back and enjoy these songs. Cheers.\n\nPS.\nThis is my first torrent, so please be nice ^_^.\n\nTorrent File List:\n\nroot:\n03 - Why Try.mp3\n11 - Walking Away.mp3\ncover.jpeg [1080x1080]\n\nTeasers:\n01 - Sample #1 - Shark Attack [Track 7].mp3\n02 - Sample #2 - 90 To 10 [Track 4].mp3\n03 - Sample #3 - Douchebag [Track 2].mp3\n\nPS.\nI named every file (besides teasers) like it's a full album - also, these MP3s (again, without Teasers, though they are also tagged) are correctly (I hope) tagged. I didn't have problems in scrobbling these into Last.fm, so you can use it that way. Teasers have also [Track x] value which corresponds to the official tracklist (I hope it really is an official tracklist, I found it on Wiki... but it looks like it is, so no worries).\n\nOK, happy listening and please seed as much as you can, so that the fans will have this available whenever they want :3.\n\nThe same info as in this description is in the NFO file, of course included ^_^.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cb1ddb56ec66813effd49aab5f97bb5fb53bed9","amp;dn":"Limp+Bizkit+-+Gold+Cobra+Sampler+by+Jimson+%5BMP3+VBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cb1ddb56ec66813effd49aab5f97bb5fb53bed9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,177,221,181,110,198,104,19,239,253,73,170,181,249,123,181,251,83,190,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
