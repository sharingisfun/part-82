All credits to him.\n\nWhat are the advantages?\n- The Japanese dubbers involve more in their role, it gives more realistic characters.\n- The Japanese dubbers are more meaningful, what has the effect of increasing the dynamism of the game.\n- The dubbing is the original, thus the one with which the game has been created, it thus corresponds to it better.\nFrom Sephizack\n\nYou will be playing the US Version of the game with audio from the original Japanese Version. Therefore, all the added cinematics in the US Version that were not in the original Japanese Version will be in English audio. But that only constitutes a very little part of the game.\n\nWorks on GEN-D3. Your savedata from US Version also work on this.\nThis has nothing to do with Universal Tuning version.\n\nAny questions/comments below\n\nSEED &amp; ENJOY!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:604b665a27e7d97e83d5027665fc5778456de274","amp;dn":"Dissidia+Final+Fantasy+Undubbed.ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"604b665a27e7d97e83d5027665fc5778456de274","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,75,102,90,39,231,217,126,131,213,2,118,101,252,87,120,69,109,226,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
