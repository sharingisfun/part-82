Lewis\nStarring: Peggy Cummins, John Dall\nColor: Black &amp; white\n\nSince he was a child, Bart Tare has always loved guns. After leaving the army, his friends take him to a carnival, where he meets the perfect girl, Annie, a sharp-shooting sideshow performer who loves guns as much as he. The two run off and marry, but Annie isn't happy with their financial situation, so at her behest the couple begins a crosscountry string of daring robberies. Never one to use guns for killing, Bart is dragged down into oblivion by the greedy and violent nature of the woman he loves.\n\nThis is my first movie rip, so please give me any suggestions for the future. I think that the video and audio quality are pretty good for an older movie. Don't forget to seed!
