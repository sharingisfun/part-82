Although she\\\\\\'s more willing than able, her brave self-confidence wins the hearts of the beleaguered GI audiences. They embrace the dauntless Verna because she, like them, is risking her life for the sake of the American dream.\n\n  Sissy Spacek  ...  Verna Vane  \n  Howard Da Silva  ...

WAC sergeant  \n\nVerna\\\\\\'s fellow troupe members include Eddie, a second-rate vaudevillian, and would-be chanteuse Maureen, who encourages Verna (of whom she observes, \\\\\\&quot;She\\\\\\'s invented a new way to sing flat and dance clumsy\\\\\\&quot;) to set aside her show business fantasies and accept a proposal of marriage offered by Army engineering captain Walter.\n\nFilmed in military training areas in Hammelberg and Baumholder, Germany by director Ronald F. Maxwell, it stars Sissy Spacek, William Hurt, Howard Da Silva, and Sally Kellerman. Period songs featured in routines created by burlesque comic Joey Faye and choreographed by Donald Saddler include \\\\\\&quot;I\\\\\\'ll Get By,\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\&quot;Jeepers, Creepers,\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;Since You Went Away.\\\\\\&quot;\n\nProduced by Thirteen/WNET New York, Verna: U.S.O. Girl was broadcast nationwide by PBS as part of the Great Performances series on January 25, 1978. Da Silva won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by a Supporting Actor in a Comedy or Drama Special, and Maxwell\\\\\\'s direction and Innuarto\\\\\\'s script received nominations.\n\nThere\\\\\\'s a great deal good about the acting in Verna: USO Girl -- good enough to transcend its television origins and make it worth repeated viewing. And it starts with Howard Da Silva\\\\\\'s portrayal of the impresario trying to organize a USO troupe, reacting to the audition of the title character in the opening scene. It extends through Sally Kellerman\\\\\\'s understated performance as a veteran performer and Da Silva\\\\\\'s hard-edged associate, and into Sissy Spacek\\\\\\'s beguiling charm as that title character, an ugly duckling of a showgirl who hopes to make it by sheer determination. And the thoughtfulness and care of this production extends right down to the clever visual trickery done with the opening credits that draw us into this endearing mix of war story and backstage drama. This is the kind of piece on which PBS built its modern reputation for excellence, drawing on a mix of talent old (Howard Da Silva, original author Paul Gallico) and new (Sissy Spacek, William Hurt), and weaving it all together seamlessly.\n\nVerna: U.S.O. Girl, a 90-minute film on PBS\\\\\\'S Great Performances series, happily ignores all the rules that plague made-for-TV movies. It is not an uplifting message drama about a trendy social or political issue. It is not a vehicle for TV stars seeking to plug an upcoming series or special. It is not a violent action spree or a self-congratulatory exercise in middlebrow culture. Verna: U.S.O. Girl is just a small story - - too small for a theatrical film but perfect for the tube -- engagingly told by talented people. It can stand as a model for what made-for-TV movies could and should be. \n\nWritten for the screen by Albert Innaurato (Gemini), one of the most gifted young U.S. playwrights, Verna is both a comic and a sorrowful account of a girl\\\\\\'s peculiar heroism. The humor can be found in Innaurato\\\\\\'s sassy dialogue, which gives new resonance to the lingo of the \\\\\\'40\\\\\\'s movies, and in the many vintage U.S.O. routines that dot the film\\\\\\'s narrative. Underneath the surface wit is Innaurato\\\\\\'s portrait of Verna\\\\\\'s aching loneliness and cultural malaise. When Verna, for the sake of her nonexistent career, jilts an Army captain whom she loves, she ceases to be a colorful eccentric and becomes a tragic victim of her bankrupt, fan-magazine values. By the time the film reaches its ironic denouement, Innaurato\\\\\\'s nostalgic affection for Verna\\\\\\'s old-fashioned innocence has turned into pity. \n\nThe high quality of the script is matched by every aspect of the production. Despite his limited budget, Director Ronald F. Maxwell has not stinted on important details: he shot the war scenes on location in Europe and enlisted Broadway Choreographer Donald Saddler and Burlesque Comic Joey Faye to help create the vaudeville numbers. Maxwell\\\\\\'s casting is precise. Spacek, playing a spiritual sister of the lost souls she acted in Badlands and 3 Women, is diaphanously vulnerable, but also makes a fine clown in her off-pitch songs. William Hurt, her awkward military suitor, is sensitive and attractive in the scenes where he tries to shield Verna from the horrors of battle. The other members of the U.S.O. show, a fraying torch singer and a has-been Catskills comic, are performed with oldtime show-biz relish by Sally Kellerman and Howard da Silva. Verna\\\\\\'s troupe is the kind of company that gives the small screen the illusion of depth.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e59c973fb2d88fe9718cd2dbedc1d87f990f80a4","amp;dn":"Verna+USO+Girl+%28TV%29+%5B1978%5D+Sissy+Spacek","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e59c973fb2d88fe9718cd2dbedc1d87f990f80a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,156,151,63,178,216,143,233,113,140,210,219,237,193,216,127,153,15,128,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
