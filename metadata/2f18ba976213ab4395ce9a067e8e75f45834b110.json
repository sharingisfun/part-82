Unfortunately, his final task is a bizarre one: to become a English teacher at an all-females boarding school. As soon as he arrives, he completely embarrasses one of his students, Asuna Kagurazaka, and replaces the teacher she loves, which garners her hatred. To make matters worse, Asuna learns that Negi is a wizard and threatens to tell unless he helps her out. Unfortunately, circumstances force them to work together - from fighting evil wizards to helping the class pass their final exam - with a lot of humor, magic and romance thrown in.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f18ba976213ab4395ce9a067e8e75f45834b110","amp;dn":"Mahou+Sensei+Negima+Vol.+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f18ba976213ab4395ce9a067e8e75f45834b110","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,24,186,151,98,19,171,67,149,206,154,6,126,142,117,244,88,52,177,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
