The album marked a minor turning point in the evolution of Lennon and McCartney as lyricists, John Lennon particularly now showing interest in composing songs of a more autobiographical nature. &quot;I'm a Loser&quot; shows Lennon for the first time seemingly coming under the influence of Bob Dylan,[1] whom he met for the first time in New York while on tour, on 28 August 1964.[2]\nNo single was released in the UK from Beatles For Sale ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the non-album tracks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Feel FineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShe's a WomanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ performed that role ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ however, that coupling was followed-up in the US by ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEight Days a WeekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which became their seventh number one in March 1965.\nThe album hit the UK number one spot and retained that position for eleven of the 46 weeks that it spent in the Top Twenty.
