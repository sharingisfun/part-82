This indirectly created a new socializing space that brought people from all walks of life together, united by their addiction to nicotine. This new social phenomenon - and the possibility of romance that it brings - inspired writer-director Pang Ho Cheung to make the romantic comedy Love in a Puff. Set in the back alleyways and empty streets of Hong Kong, the film stars Miriam Yeung (Love Undercover) and Shawn Yue (Infernal Affairs) in an unlikely romance set off by the flicker of a lighter. Co-written by up-and-coming young director Heiward Mak (High Noon), Love in a Puff is Pang's first Category III film due to its fill of crude jokes and adult language. However, a sweet and charming romance lies at the film's core, making it also the director's lightest - and funniest - film yet. Love in a Puff initially opened to only a modest box office gross, but praise for the offbeat romance traveled quickly around Hong Kong youths, turning it into a rare sleeper hit over its extended theatrical run in spring 2010.\n\n\n\nAudio :  Dolby Digital 5.1 - 448kbps\n\n                     (1) cantonese\n                     (2) mandarin     \n\n Subs : English , Chinese x 2 \n\nNTSC\n\n\n\nHong Kong romantic comedy, no wire fu, no gunfights, no boobs.\n\nthough quick download while Leechers are plenty\n\n\nRegular DVDR converted from a BluRayRip , playable on a standalone dvd player\n\nsimple custom menu\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4dd88a48f3e8e15fb07edb0271f4377ecf253ac","amp;dn":"Love+in+a+Puff+2010+BRRip+DVDr-sailo1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4dd88a48f3e8e15fb07edb0271f4377ecf253ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,221,136,164,143,62,142,21,251,7,237,176,39,31,67,119,236,242,83,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
