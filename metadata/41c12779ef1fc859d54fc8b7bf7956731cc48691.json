Having narrowly escaped the deranged Force worshippers known as the Mind Walkers, and a deadly Sith hit squad, Luke and Ben Skywalker are in pursuit of the now Masterless Sith apprentice Vestara Khai. It is a chase that leads to the forbidding planet Dathomir, where an enclave of powerful dark-side Force-wielders will give Vestara the edge she needs to escape; and where the Skywalkers will be forced into combat for their quarry and their lives.\nMeanwhile, Han and Leia Solo are on their own desperate mission, shuttling madness-stricken Jedi from Coruscant to safe haven in the Transitory Mists and beyond the grasp of Galactic Alliance Chief of State Natasi Daala. But the bold maneuver only intensifies Daala\\'s fury, and she is determined to shatter Jedi Order resistance once and for all.\nYet, no greater threat exists than that which still waits in the depths of the distant Maw Cluster: A being of pure, ravenous dark-side energy named Abeloth calls out across the stars to Jedi and Sith alike. For some, it may be the ultimate source of answers crucial to their survival. For others, it could be the ultimate weapon of conquest. But for all, it is a game-changing and life-altering encounter of untold magnitude, and a tactical gambit with unimaginable consequences.\n\nAll the other e-books from this Fate of The Jedi Series are on TPB except this one, so IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve found it elsewhere and brought it here.  Many thanks to the original uploader.\n\nThis is my first upload so please leave feedback.  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41c12779ef1fc859d54fc8b7bf7956731cc48691","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+%5BFate+of+the+Jedi+4%5D+Backlash+by+Aaron+Allston%5BPDF.Doc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41c12779ef1fc859d54fc8b7bf7956731cc48691","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,193,39,121,239,31,200,89,213,79,200,183,191,121,86,115,28,196,134,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
