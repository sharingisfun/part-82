This is my first torrent created for the awesome Southern, Ca based Rock group, Death to the Mckenzies.  This is their first album entitled Control Theory. I believe they recorded it independently and released it on their own label P.C.P. Records.\nAnyway, I've been waiting for this album since I saw them open for Weezer at the Palladium.  They are a kick ass band that actually rock and have an amazing energy on stage. So if you don't already own their cd, check it out, I think they rock and have a promising future.\nSo if you like them, support the band, you can find them at,, reverbnation.com/deathtothemckenzies or basically anywhere, just google or bing search them.\n\nThe files include all 12 tracks\nCover art-Jpeg format\nFiles are Flac\nDRM-FREE\n\nPlease seed and share so the pirate bay can stay great:) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:080d19edac003cf0de49c579a010892e9a182362","amp;dn":"Death+to+the+Mckenzies+-+Control+Theory+Flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"080d19edac003cf0de49c579a010892e9a182362","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,13,25,237,172,0,60,240,222,73,197,121,160,16,137,46,154,24,35,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
