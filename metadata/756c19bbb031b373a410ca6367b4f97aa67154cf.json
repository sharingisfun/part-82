Thank you for the very fine words on H.B.\n\nThe main thing about SuperCharger is that they spend two years of playing approximately more than 50 concerts per year, before they decided that it was time to hit the studio and record their debut album Handgrenade Blues. That is today the guarantee of a 100% full blooded live band. They are good at it and it is a live show the way it really should be. One hell of a party and no one in the crowd is left standing still.\n\nHandgrenade Blues is the studio version of SuperChargerÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s music, on which they have focused on catching some of the live action. SuperProducer Tue Madsen (Antfarm) and Mastering Chief Jan Elisasson (AudioPlanet) have recorded and engineered these 11 tracks of Hard Rock &amp; Roll, heading towards some South State attitude and with all kinds of classic rock influences. You be the judge.\n\nSuperCharger includes piano, Hammond and harmonica to the pounding drums and the low tuned guitars. And in the spirit of rock and roll; itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all topped off with harsh whiskey vocals and melody tunes that sticks.\n\n2008/2009 was busy years with recordings, touring w/ Mustasch, D.A.D., loads of one-offs and their own headlining DK Tour. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“and they can now also fully welcome ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMr. Lars Lee LewisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to the tour crew, as the boss of finger-easy piano and harmonica.\n\nSuperChargerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2010 start out with winning an award in the category ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBest Debut Album of the Year 2009ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, at DMeA in Copenhagen and releasing the still fresh album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHandgrenade BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in other European regions. So far the 2010 plan for the Danish rock &amp; rollers is to tour, tour and tour!\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:756c19bbb031b373a410ca6367b4f97aa67154cf","amp;dn":"SuperCharger+-+Handgrenade+Blues+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"756c19bbb031b373a410ca6367b4f97aa67154cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,108,25,187,176,49,179,115,164,16,202,99,103,180,249,122,166,113,84,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
