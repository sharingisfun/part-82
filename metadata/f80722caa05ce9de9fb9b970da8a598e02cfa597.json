They last contested a final in 2005 and the last time they actually lifted the trophy was way back in 1999.\n\nSt Helens, on the other hand, won the trophy three times in succession from 2006 to 2008 before they surrendered their crown to Warrington last year. The match is played at Huddersfield's Galpharm Stadium.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f80722caa05ce9de9fb9b970da8a598e02cfa597","amp;dn":"Rugby+League+Challenge+Cup+Semi-Final+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f80722caa05ce9de9fb9b970da8a598e02cfa597","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,7,34,202,160,92,233,222,159,185,185,112,218,138,89,142,2,207,165,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
