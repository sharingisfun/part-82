The music is an alternative form of electro-pop\nwith emotion, some dark/light humour and uplifting beats.\n\nThe name &quot;Mallorca Scars&quot; is a fantasy about Mallorca - of being a kid on\ncharter with parents who leave you alone in the hotel room while they're out\npartying ( &quot;grisfestandes&quot; ).\n\n\n01.
