All the baby food, all the cigarettes, all the condoms, all the snacks, all the soda..it's almost all here. Images were taken over about 3 months in 2008 and required over a dozen trips to various stores.\n\nAll of these pictures were taken for my video piece, 10000 items or less, which you can view here: http://vimeo.com/890119\n\nI am hoping that people will find some interesting ways to play with such a large set of images. For example, I considered making a version of the video where I sorted all of the images by color, but never got around to it. An average of all of the frames could also be interesting.\n\nThe images are released under a Creative Commons - Attribution - NonCommercial - ShareAlike 3.0 license\n\nIf you come up with anything interesting, please let me know...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f989f6765e59a79d6334e046a9621a583cfb4616","amp;dn":"10%2C000+items+or+less+-+Every+image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f989f6765e59a79d6334e046a9621a583cfb4616","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,137,246,118,94,89,167,157,99,52,224,70,169,98,26,88,60,251,70,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
