After dominating British politics for years, Lang has retired with his wife to the USA. He lives on an island, in luxurious, isolated premises complete with a security detail and a secretarial staff. Soon, Adam Lang gets embroiled in a major scandal with international ramifications that reveals how far he was ready to go in order to nurture UK's &quot;special relationship&quot; with the USA. But before this controversy has started, before even he has closed the deal with the publisher, the ghost-writer gets unmistakable signs that the turgid draft he is tasked to put into shape inexplicably constitutes highly sensitive material.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fcc79358363c39682c0acc45a031a2eed34c23a","amp;dn":"The.Ghost.Writer.DVDRip.XviD-NeDiVx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fcc79358363c39682c0acc45a031a2eed34c23a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,204,121,53,131,99,195,150,130,192,172,196,90,3,26,46,237,52,194,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
