Charlie           \n           Shepard is a modern day faith healer, a man who claims         \n           that if you let go and believe, then his power to heal is      \n           very real indeed. Living a hand-to-mouth, blue collar          \n           existence with his wife Rebecca and young son, Charlie         \n           ekes out a meager living from his &quot;healing&quot; sessions.          \n           With his marriage failing, and an old drinking habit           \n           coming back to haunt him, his family is brutally murdered      \n           by unknown assailants for seemingly no reason whatsoever.      \n           Six months later, Charlie has abandoned his former life        \n           and the house his family lived in, moving through the          \n           days' slow existence more like a ghost than a man. But         \n           then a young, mysterious girl named Sarah appears in           \n           town, and seeks out Charlie. She will become the link to       \n           his family's killings and to the murderers themselves,         \n           ultimately leading to tragic, violent consequences for         \n           all. &quot;Godspeed&quot; is a film that explores faith, grief, and      \n           the dark, violent nature that may very well exist in all       \n           of us -- where man is still truly lost and at the mercy        \n           of the Last Frontier of the great Alaskan landscape.           \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           Joseph McKelheer........... : ............Charlie Shepard      \n           Cory Knauf................. : ...............Luke Roberts      \n           Courtney Halverson......... : ..............Sarah Roberts      \n           Ed Lauter.................. : ......................Mitch      \n           Jessie Ward................ : ............Rebecca Shepard      \n           Hallock Beals.............. : ........................Tim      \n           Lynn A.
