The success of The X-Files on Fox proved there was an audience for genre shows, resulting in NBC commissioning this proposed competitor following a pitch from producers Bryce Zabel and Brent Friedman. The series debuted September 21, 1996 on NBC, and was later rerun by the Sci-Fi Channel. Its tagline was, &quot;History as we know it is a lie.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21b26ad1dfce4d06494f7fdb7eee78b0056b457c","amp;dn":"Dark.Skies.S01.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21b26ad1dfce4d06494f7fdb7eee78b0056b457c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,178,106,209,223,206,77,6,73,79,127,219,126,238,120,176,5,107,69,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
