Captain Alex Hamilton is sent with his spaceship and crew to the space outside the Solar System to find the origin of that signal.

The robot's got his eyes on the Earth, too.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2374155f5ec3eb0c2b852245018f6f72a0b21f64","amp;dn":"Cosmos+-+War+Of+The+Planets+or+%28Anno+zero+-+guerra+nello+spazio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2374155f5ec3eb0c2b852245018f6f72a0b21f64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,116,21,95,94,195,235,12,43,133,34,69,1,143,111,114,160,178,31,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
