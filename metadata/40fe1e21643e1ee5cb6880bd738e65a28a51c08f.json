A day after the March 16 order was filed on the court's electronic docket, the opinion vanished. Weeks later, a new ruling appeared in its place. While it reached the same conclusion, eight pages of material had been removed, including key passages in which Kennedy dismantled the government's case against Uthman.\n\n\n- Nueva York: Museum Exhibit Documents Latino Role in Shaping New York City over Three Centuries\n\nThe history of Latinos in New York is the focus of a new exhibit at El Museo del Barrio in Spanish Harlem. The exhibition looks at the relationship between New York City and the Spanish-speaking world from 1613 to the end of World War II. We speak with Mike Wallace, a professor of history at the City University of New York and chief historian for the Nueva York exhibit. Mike Wallace is co-author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898.
