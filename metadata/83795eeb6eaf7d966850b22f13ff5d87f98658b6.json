It has Service Pack 2 integrated into the Windows XP flavors. It's still old, but it's more up to date than the Windows DVD floating around on the Internet (the original XiSO one). Since SP2 is still current, this disc isn't quite obsolete yet... I hope to integrate SP3 if it ever comes out for XP, and bring Server 2003 up to date as well (I think it has RTM on this disc, no service pack).\n\nOriginal ISO by XiSO, modified, repackaged, and seeded by me (Falcon4). The torrent comment says it's tracked by me too, but that was before Microsoft sent me a nasty letter telling me to shut my tracker down, effectively killing the original torrent a few months after it was first put up. I was prompted to re-upload this torrent for the first time a few years later (today, August 2007) when I found a lone peer connected to my still-seeding torrent on uTorrent via DHT. I'm impressed. Someone must still want it. So here it is, world, enjoy!\n\nThis torrent actually got corrupted on my hard drive (the only remaining copy on the Internet, it seems) and I almost gave up on it. With a long, in depth reading of the WinRAR technote.txt and an extracted copy of the ISO from a friend, I was able to patch the ISO data into the corrupt archive and rebuild the header with a hex editor and Windows' calculator. Finally, after being corrupted for almost a whole year, I was able to continue seeding the torrent.
