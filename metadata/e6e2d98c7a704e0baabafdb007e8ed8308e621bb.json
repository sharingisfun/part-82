Taking a local family hostage, Sinatra sets up a vigil at the second-story window of the family's home. From here, he intends to kill the President of the United States when the latter makes a whistle-stop visit. The film's tension level is enough to induce goose pimples from first scene to last. Sinatra is outstanding as the disgruntled war vet who hopes to become a &quot;somebody&quot; by killing the president. The parallels between his character and Lee Harvey Oswald's are too close for comfort, so much so that Suddenly was withdrawn from local TV packages for several years after the JFK assassination. Sinatra would claim in later years that he himself engineered the removal of Suddenly from general distribution, though in fact he'd lost whatever rights he'd held on the film when it lapsed into public domain. Be sure and miss the notorious colorized version of this black-and-white thriller, wherein Sinatra is transformed into Ol' Brown Eyes. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047542/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047542/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-35299&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-35299&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:15:19\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x464 1.55:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 2314 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,30 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6e2d98c7a704e0baabafdb007e8ed8308e621bb","amp;dn":"Suddenly+%281954%29+Frank+Sinatra+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6e2d98c7a704e0baabafdb007e8ed8308e621bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,226,217,140,122,112,78,11,170,186,253,176,7,232,237,131,8,230,33,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
