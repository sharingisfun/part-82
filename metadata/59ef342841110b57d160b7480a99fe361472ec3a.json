Confronting both his own limitations and the awesome power of nature's uncontrollable elements, Peter risks his life to save his sister, Annie, and her summit team in a race against time. The team is trapped in an icy grave at 26,000 feet - a death zone above the vertical limit of endurance where the human body cannot survive for long. Every second counts as Peter enlists the help of a crew of fellow climbers, including eccentric, reclusive mountain man Montgomery Wick, to ascend the chilling might of the world's most feared peak to save her. \n\nPlease seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59ef342841110b57d160b7480a99fe361472ec3a","amp;dn":"Vertical+Limit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59ef342841110b57d160b7480a99fe361472ec3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,239,52,40,65,17,11,87,209,96,183,72,10,153,254,54,20,114,236,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
