Starmine is the first track that got him into the music industry, this homage title and the album it represents is a compilation of the many hits he has produced on the first disc, and those same tracks remixed by other Bemani artists on disc two.\n\nIt's hard for me to just name off the good tracks, since he has made so many songs that are good, I'll just state that you should listen to the entire album. As far as last.fm playcounts though:\n#1 Bass 2 Bass\n#2 Second Heaven\n#3 Mind Mapping\n#4 Aurora\n#5 Be Quiet\n\nAs for my favorite tracks on the album, I'm divided between &quot;waxing and wanding -kors k mix-&quot; (Gabber) and &quot;Be quiet -SF_Glitch Techno Mix-&quot; (Techno).\n\nDisc 01 - Original Album\n01.
