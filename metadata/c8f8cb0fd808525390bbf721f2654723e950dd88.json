Canyon Spirit was recorded &quot;live&quot; amongst the Native American ruins of the Ancient Canyons in and around the Canyonlands of the Great Desert Southwest. There are no other instruments...just the sounds of Native American Flutes and nature.\nThe Native American Indian ruins of the Anasazi, who lived deep in the canyons and high amongst the mesas and plateaus of this mystical Southwestern landscape, provide the perfect Spirit Music for tranquil meditation as well as a contemplative backdrop for these exquisite Native American flute songs.\n\nTrack List\n\n1-Against the Sky\t\t\t\n2-Visions of Moonlight Creek\t\t\t\n3-Daybreak at Lost Eden Canyon\t\t\t\n4-Trail of the Old Ones\t\t\t\n5-Forgotten Plateaus\t\t\t\n6-Canyon Spirit\t\t\t\n7-Natural Bridges\t\t\t\n8-Red Rock Crossing\t\t\t\n9-Sacred Rituals\t\t\t\n10-Echo Canyon\t\t\t\n11-Calling to the Shadows\t\t\t\n12-For Those Who Have Left Us\t\t\t\n\n\nFormat-FLAC\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8f8cb0fd808525390bbf721f2654723e950dd88","amp;dn":"John+Huling-Canyon+Spirit%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8f8cb0fd808525390bbf721f2654723e950dd88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,248,203,15,216,8,82,83,144,187,247,33,242,101,71,35,233,80,221,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
