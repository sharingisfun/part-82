Filmed at the Koko club in Camden, London, the\n      show is recorded in front of a live audience with celebrities\n      and politicians packing the bar. Plus, in a regular guest spot a\n      topical public figure or celebrity guest has to endure two\n      minutes in 'The Chair'. This new show is intelligent, spiky and\n      above all, outrageously alternative.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
