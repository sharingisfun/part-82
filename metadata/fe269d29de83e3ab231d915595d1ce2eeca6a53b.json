The events of Incursion link into the events of the comic mini-series Mass Effect: Redemption.\n\nIn Mass Effect: Incursion, Aria interrupts a meeting between the Collectors and Blue Suns, who are bartering over a group of humans. After killing everyone involved, Aria learns that the Collectors have sinister plans for humanity. \n\nSorry about the 7th page it was originally a pdf file that I converted but originally you could not even read that page so this is actually better.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe269d29de83e3ab231d915595d1ce2eeca6a53b","amp;dn":"Mass+Effect+Incursion+-+Mac+Walters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe269d29de83e3ab231d915595d1ce2eeca6a53b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,38,157,41,222,131,227,171,35,29,145,85,149,209,206,46,236,166,165,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
