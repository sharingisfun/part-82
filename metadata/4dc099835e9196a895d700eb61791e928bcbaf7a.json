Violins, pianos, pads, and very pretty synthesizers make up his compositions. Trancer's Dolls, Cristears, and Dramatic Irony are all albums I can listen to in their entirety, and take off my headphones feeling euphoric.\nEnjoy the album, it's only seven tracks long, and hopefully you'll find something you like. That Pure Ruby....\n\n\n01. Mercury Lamp\n02. Canary\n03. Jade Star\n04. Lapis\n05. Pure Ruby\n06. KLEINE\n07.
