It became the lowest charting first single ever by the band and marked a change in the composition of the singles chart as well as the Stones role on it. Five years earlier &quot;Mixed Emotions&quot; was a Top 5 pop chart single. Considerable promotional expense was spent on the Voodoo Lounge CD release, as it was the first on Virgin Records, including a popular music video directed by David Fincher and edited by Robert Duffy at Spot Welders; the black and white video shows giant versions of the Stones, as well as a few residents locked in romantic embraces, rambling about New York City.\n\nThe single's weaker than expected lead dampened CD sales despite positive critical reviews and even an eventual Grammy Award. In time, the track proved popular in Europe going to number 14 in the United Kingdom and received significant airplay in the United States. The Rolling Stones performed the song at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nAlthough it had disappeared from several recent concert tours setlists in favour of the more live friendly &quot;You Got Me Rocking&quot; (the follow-up single from Voodoo Lounge), the Stones reintroduced &quot;Love is Strong&quot; to their A Bigger Bang Tour setlist on July 22, 2007 at their Brno, Czech Republic show and at their Hamburg show in August.\n\nIt was included on their 2002 career compilation album Forty Licks.\n\nWritten by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, &quot;Love Is Strong&quot; is a brooding number about an encounter between the singer and an unnamed person which leads the singer to a &quot;love/lust at first sight&quot; immediate attraction and longing for the couple to unite despite the obstacles.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ \tYour love is strong and you're so sweet;\nYou make me hard, you make me weak;\nLove is strong and you're so sweet,\nAnd some day, baby, we've got to meet... \tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ \tWhat are you scared of, baby?; It's more than just a dream;\nI need some time; We make a beautiful team... \tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe song was written in Ireland by Richards and originally had the name &quot;Love is Strange&quot;. Popular bootlegs of the sessions abound, as Ron Wood, Richards, Ivan Neville and producer Don Was worked the song while Jagger was supporting his record Wandering Spirit. Later takes have Richards changing the title to &quot;Love is Strong&quot;; although the final release was significantly altered by Jagger's added lyrics and use of a harmonica, a trademark instrument for him rarely utilized in the Stones' middle period work. Jagger said at the time of its release, &quot;We ran through it a bunch of times and I was playing harmonica, and I started singing through the harmonica mike, so you get this strange sort of sound. And then I started singing down an octave, so you get this kind of breathy, sexy tone... It was good to put harmonica on a track like this. You always think of playing it on a 12-bar blues, and it's kind of fun to put it on one which isn't. It's good to work with another sequence.&quot;\n\nRecording began in September, 1993 at Wood's home studio in Ireland and continued at A&amp;M Recording Studios in Los Angeles in 1994.\n\nVoodoo Lounge is the 20th studio album by The Rolling Stones, released in July 1994. As their first new release under their new alliance with Virgin Records, it ended a five-year gap since their last studio album, Steel Wheels in 1989. Voodoo Lounge is also The Rolling Stones' first album without long-time bassist Bill Wyman, who departed the line-up in early 1993. In 2009, Voodoo Lounge was remastered and reissued by Universal Music.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b31d68ad291a673471c819550905b3b247479c61","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Love+Is+Strong+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b31d68ad291a673471c819550905b3b247479c61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,29,104,173,41,26,103,52,113,200,25,85,9,5,179,178,71,71,156,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
