ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe album is a tale. The first part of it is a very dark and sordid story. Everything after that is progressively more positive, reassuring and redemptive.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ songs include the menacing, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPoor Man Blues,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the defiant ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Cash My Checks,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the sighing and bluesy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEven the Skies Are BlueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the chilling ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeartache.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The lighter, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ songs are highlighted by the strongly autobiographical ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Why I Write Songs,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the languid ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFront Porch Swing Afternoon,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the rocking ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGood Times AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t What They Used to BeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the easy-going groove tune ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMacon.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The ambitious projectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s textures are many and varied. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBaby DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t CryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a lullaby. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Remember YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a gospel song. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s How I DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Love YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a deeply sad power ballad. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBy the Seat of Your PantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tells of lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lessons. The title tune, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Guitar Song,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is told from the point of view of two forgotten guitars hanging on a pawn shop wall. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPlaying the PartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCalifornia RiotsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ come from feeling out of place as a country boy in Hollywood. As a lover of classic country sounds, he regularly performs oldies in his stage shows. The Guitar Song contains ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFor the Good Times,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSet `Em Up JoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMental RevengeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.
