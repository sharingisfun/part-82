I have watched it 3 times in the last 48hrs.\n\nEncoded for PSP, iPod, and Zune.   Enjoy Guys!\n\nI recommend that everyone should watch this! It will get your heart racing and your adrenaline pumping!\n\nMovie NFO And A Review - - - \n\nTekken is more serious and has cool action scenes than the other fighting adaptations. Even the acting though still not that good is still at least better than the recent Street Fighter: The legend of Chun Li which has laughable acting especially by Chris Klien. The reason that there are negative reviews, most reviewers are fan of the game. Those outside the game world will still be able to get a hang of it as the plot is simple though characters are not properly introduced. Still, Tekken makes up with its non-stop brutal and realistic fight scenes.\n\nThe story: Jin wants to take revenge against Heihachi Mishima, the controller of the violent Tekken who killed Jin\\'s mother. Okay, from here it is predictable and there is a mild twist. But I went to watch it not because of its story/acting but because of its fight scenes. I must say this video adaptation has the best fight scenes of all fighting video game adaptations. Mortal Kombat is weak, Street Fighter movies are a wuss in fight scenes and DOA is alright. Finally, we gets Tekken which has hard-hitting fight scenes which are the main highlight of the movie. Though the climax is a little disappointing, I expected more on the epic showdown. Those who say that the music does not match the movie or the fight scenes, it is okay and does match the seriousness of Jin\\'s journey.\n\nOverall: Tekken is actually your typical fighting/action movie but what it stands out is the hard-hitting fight scenes. I am sorry to say that I enjoy this. It is actually one of the video games adaptations that I like. It is serious and has real hard-core action unlike recent ones like Prince of Persia. \n\nVideo Specs: \nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nCodec ID                         : M4V \nFile size                        : 396 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 27mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 633 Kbps\nMovie name                       : Tekken (2010)\nEncoded date                     : 2010\nWriting application              : Lavf52.33.0\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;8ecceffdebe2e7e0ebcec2bfa0bd&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : No\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 1 frame\nCodec ID                         : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                    : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                         : 1h 27mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 500 Kbps\nWidth                            : 320 pixels\nHeight                           : 240 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate mode                  : Constant\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.217\nStream size                      : 313 MiB (79%)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version                   : Version 4\nFormat profile                   : LC\nFormat settings, SBR             : No\nCodec ID                         : 40\nDuration                         : 1h 27mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 80.1 MiB (20%)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b90802f0e55f8a59c9ec8b76bcea5394b59bf360","amp;dn":"%28Recommended%29+Tekken+%282010%29+%28PSP%2C+iPod%2C+Zune%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b90802f0e55f8a59c9ec8b76bcea5394b59bf360","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,8,2,240,229,95,138,89,201,236,139,118,188,234,83,148,181,155,243,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
