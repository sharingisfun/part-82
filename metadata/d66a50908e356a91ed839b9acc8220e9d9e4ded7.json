In August 2007, Noelia accused her stepfather and former manager, Topy Mamery, of sexually assaulting her back in 2003; she claimed to have filed a lawsuit, calling singer Ricardo Montaner as a witness. However, Mamery denied having received any lawsuit, and Montaner denied ever having been called to testify. During an interview with Primer Impacto, Montaner was asked about this and he said, &quot;I have never seen anything weird (between Noelia and Mamery). Mamery is a gentleman that has loved Noelia as her daughter.&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d66a50908e356a91ed839b9acc8220e9d9e4ded7","amp;dn":"Noelia+-+Toco+La+Luz+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d66a50908e356a91ed839b9acc8220e9d9e4ded7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,106,80,144,142,53,106,145,237,131,155,154,204,130,32,233,217,228,222,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
