In all honesty we grabbed them to use instead of resyncing from scratch, hence the reason we noticed the oos parts, so in the end we redid the sync ...\nalso hence the delay getting this out.\n\nUPLOADER NOTES\nIN MY MOST HUMBLE OPINION...FLAWL3SS &amp; IMAGiNE IS BEST OUT SO FAR...SO PICK YOUR PREFERRED RELEASE GROUP...PLEASE COMMENT :)\n\ncredit IMAGiNE &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, extremezone, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:997f7fe8f8ff3ea2dedf5efeadecc74b1e1b4e5b","amp;dn":"The+A+Team+R5+LiNE+XViD+-+IMAGINE%28best+version+so+far%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"997f7fe8f8ff3ea2dedf5efeadecc74b1e1b4e5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,127,127,232,248,255,62,162,222,223,94,254,173,236,199,75,30,27,78,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
