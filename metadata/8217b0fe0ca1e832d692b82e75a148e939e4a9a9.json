Rowling. \n\nIt is the tale of Harry Potter, an ordinary 11-year-old boy serving as a sort of slave for his aunt and uncle who learns \n\nthat he is actually a wizard and has been invited to attend the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is \n\nsnatched away from his mundane existence by Hagrid, the grounds keeper for Hogwarts, and quickly thrown into a \n\nworld completely foreign to both him and the viewer. Famous for an incident that happened at his birth, Harry makes \n\nfriends easily at his new school. He soon finds, however, that the wizarding world is far more dangerous for him than \n\nhe would have imagined, and he quickly learns that not all wizards are ones to be trusted\n\nRichard Harris   \t...  \tProfessor Albus Dumbledore\nMaggie Smith \t        ... \tProfessor Minerva McGonagall\nRobbie Coltrane \t... \tRubeus Hagrid\nSaunders Triplets \t... \tBaby Harry Potter\nDaniel Radcliffe \t... \tHarry Potter\nFiona Shaw \t        ... \tAunt Petunia Dursley\nHarry Melling \t        ... \tDudley Dursley\nRichard Griffiths \t... \tUncle Vernon Dursley\nDerek Deadman \t        ... \tTom - Bartender in Leaky Cauldron\nIan Hart \t\t... \tProfessor Quirinus Quirrell\nBen Borowiecki \t        ... \tDiagon Alley Boy\nWarwick Davis \t        ... \tGoblin Bank Teller / Professor Flitwick\nVerne Troyer \t        ... \tGriphook the Goblin (as Vern Troyer)\nJohn Hurt \t        ... \tMr. Ollivander\nRichard Bremmer \t... \tHe Who Must Not Be Named \n\n\n\n\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n\nForced to spend his summer holidays with his muggle relations, Harry Potter gets a real shock when he gets a \n\nsurprise visitor: Dobby the house-elf, who warns Harry Potter against returning to Hogwarts, for terrible things are \n\ngoing to happen. Harry decides to ignore Dobby's warning and continues with his pre-arranged schedule. But at \n\nHogwarts, strange and terrible things are indeed happening: Harry is suddenly hearing mysterious voices from inside \n\nthe walls, muggle-born students are being attacked, and a message scrawled on the wall in blood puts everyone on \n\nhis/her guard - &quot;The Chamber Of Secrets Has Been Opened.

He runs away after using magic to inflate Uncle \n\nVernon's sister Marge who was being offensive towards Harry's parents. Initially scared for using magic outside the \n\nschool, he is pleasantly surprised that he won't be penalized after all. However, he soon learns that a dangerous \n\ncriminal and Voldemort's trusted aide Sirius Black has escaped from the Azkaban prison and wants to kill Harry to \n\navenge the Dark Lord. To worsen the conditions for Harry, vile shape-shifters called Dementors are appointed to \n\nguard the school gates and inexplicably happen to have the most horrible effect on him. Little does Harry know that \n\nby the end of this year, many holes in his past (whatever he knows of it) will be filled up and he will have a clearer \n\nvision of what the future has in store.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe   \t...  \tHarry Potter\nRichard Griffiths \t... \tUncle Vernon\nPam Ferris \t        ... \tAunt Marge\nFiona Shaw \t        ... \tAunt Petunia\nHarry Melling \t        ... \tDudley Dursley\nAdrian Rawlins \t        ... \tJames Potter\nGeraldine Somerville \t... \tLily Potter\nLee Ingleby \t        ... \tStan Shunpike\nLenny Henry \t        ... \tShrunken Head\nJimmy Gardner \t        ... \tErnie the Bus Driver\nGary Oldman \t        ... \tSirius Black\nJim TavarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© \t        ... \tTom the Innkeeper\nRobert Hardy \t        ... \tCornelius Fudge\nAbby Ford \t        ... \tYoung Witch Maid\nRupert Grint \t        ... \tRon Weasley \n\n\n\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\n\nHarry's fourth year at Hogwarts is about to start and he is enjoying the summer vacation with his friends. They get \n\nthe tickets to The Quidditch World Cup Final but after the match is over, people dressed like Lord Voldemort's 'Death \n\nEaters' set a fire to all the visitors' tents, coupled with the appearance of Voldemort's symbol, the 'Dark Mark' in the \n\nsky, which causes a frenzy across the magical community. That same year, Hogwarts is hosting 'The Triwizard \n\nTournament', a magical tournament between three well-known schools of magic : Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and \n\nDurmstrang. The contestants have to be above the age of 17, and are chosen by a magical object called Goblet of Fire. \n\nOn the night of selection, however, the Goblet spews out four names instead of the usual three, with Harry \n\nunwittingly being selected as the Fourth Champion. Since the magic cannot be reversed, Harry is forced to go with it \n\nand brave three exceedingly difficult tasks.\n\nEric Sykes   \t        ...  \tFrank Bryce\nTimothy Spall \t        ... \tWormtail (Peter Pettigrew)\nDavid Tennant \t        ... \tBartemius 'Barty' Crouch Junior\nDaniel Radcliffe \t... \tHarry Potter\nEmma Watson \t        ... \tHermione Granger\nRupert Grint \t        ... \tRon Weasley\nMark Williams \t        ... \tArthur Weasley\nJames Phelps \t        ... \tFred Weasley\nOliver Phelps \t        ... \tGeorge Weasley\nBonnie Wright \t        ... \tGinny Weasley\nJeff Rawle \t        ... \tAmos Diggory\nRobert Pattinson \t... \tCedric Diggory\nJason Isaacs \t        ... \tLucius Malfoy\nTom Felton \t        ... \tDraco Malfoy\nStanislav Ianevski \t... \tViktor Krum \n\n\n\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n\nAfter a lonely summer on Privet Drive, Harry returns to a Hogwarts full of ill-fortune. Few of students and parents \n\nbelieve him or Dumbledore that Voldemort is really back. The ministry had decided to step in by appointing a new \n\nDefence Against the Dark Arts teacher that proves to be the nastiest person Harry has ever encountered. Harry also \n\ncan't help stealing glances with the beautiful Cho Chang. To top it off are dreams that Harry can't explain, and a \n\nmystery behind something Voldemort is searching for. With these many things Harry begins one of his toughest \n\nyears at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe   \t...  \tHarry Potter\nHarry Melling \t        ... \tDudley Dursley\nJason Boyd \t        ... \tPiers\nRichard Macklin \t... \tMalcolm\nKathryn Hunter \t        ... \tMrs. Arabella Figg\nMiles Jupp \t        ... \tTV Weatherman\nFiona Shaw \t        ... \tAunt Petunia Dursley\nRichard Griffiths \t... \tUncle Vernon Dursley\nJessica Hynes \t        ... \tMafalda Hopkirk (voice) (as Jessica Stevenson)\nAdrian Rawlins \t        ... \tJames Potter\nGeraldine Somerville \t... \tLily Potter\nRobert Pattinson \t... \tCedric Diggory\nRalph Fiennes \t        ... \tLord Voldemort\nNatalia Tena \t        ... \tNymphadora Tonks\nBrendan Gleeson \t... \tAlastor 'Mad-Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­Eye' Moody \n\n\n\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n\nIn the sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft, and in both wizard and muggle worlds Lord Voldemort and his \n\nhenchmen are increasingly active.
