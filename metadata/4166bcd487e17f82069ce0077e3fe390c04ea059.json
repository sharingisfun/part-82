While some consider it one of the best hindi films ever made, it certainly is one of the best of the last 20 years.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/SatyaT_160.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/SatyaT_160.gif&lt;/a&gt;\nA young man named Satya (J.D Chakravarthy) comes to Mumbai from South India in search of a job. Jailed for something he did not do, the once-honest young man meets an underworld boss, Bhiku Mhatre (Manoj Bajpai) in jail and joins his gang. He lives in a poor neighborhood, where he meets, Vidya (Urmila Matondkar), who lives next door. She is not aware of his underworld connections. Satya slowly rises up the ranks of his gang, and becomes the most influential person. Satya is torn between his girlfriend and his gangster life.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195231/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195231/&lt;/a&gt;\nRating ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8.3/10\n\nLanguage ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Hindi\nSubtitles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ English (.srt) The dialogues are subtitled, the song lyrics are not\n\nOne of the most intelligent movies ever made about gangsters,\nAuthor: Simon Booth from UK\nSATYA stands out from the normal Bollywood romance fair, being a rather dark and gritty look at the crime underworld of Mumbai. The movie follows the fortunes of a guy called Satya (lit: &quot;Truth&quot;) in the underworld, and the subtle script explores the theme with a lot of depth.\n\nSatya himself is a wonderful character, one of my favourite screen characters ever in fact. Part of this is due to his fantastic beard, but the depth and humanity his character and the performance of J.D.Chakravarti have contribute a lot too.\n\nThe script and direction of SATYA show a sharpness that cuts to the core of its subject matter in a way that the song and dance routines of the blockbuster movies from any country do. The 3 hour running time allows it to develop and nurture its themes very thoroughly. The result is one of the most palpably intelligent movies ever made about gangsters.\n\nThis is no romanticised &quot;cool of the killer&quot; type movie, it's a pretty honest and thought provoking look at a lifestyle that hopefully nobody reading this has direct involvement with.\n\nStrong recommendation to see!\n\nVideo\nCodec--XVID \nLength--2:52:41 (248,39 frms)\nResolution--640 x 320\nDar--2.000 (2:1)\nFPS--23.976\nBitrate--1003\nQF--0.204\n\nAudio\n0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3 44100Hz  128 kb/s tot , Stereo &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-10-12-10h48m33s193.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-10-12-10h48m33s193.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-10-12-10h48m06s90.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-10-12-10h48m06s90.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-10-12-10h49m21s157.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-10-12-10h49m21s157.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-10-12-10h50m37s135.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-10-12-10h50m37s135.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-10-12-10h52m15s107.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2010-10-12-10h52m15s107.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
