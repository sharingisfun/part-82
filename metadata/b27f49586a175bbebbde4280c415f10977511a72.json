He decides to start a free medical college, and a free hospital, and faces a number of obstacles en route by way of corrupt officials and a political kingpin who sabotages his work. Beaten down by politicians, he decides to take matters into his own hands by overhauling the entire system using his own private army of supporters. Meanwhile, he romances Tamilselvi (Shriya), who unfortunately has been told by an astrologer that her future husband is doomed to die soon. Loaded with Rajni-style antics such as flicking coins, acrobatically bouncing chewing gum around, and swapping guns from hand to hand whilst flying through the air, the film has a lot to offer for Rajni fans, and also has the usual social development message featuring Rajni as the Messiah. The song picturizations are good and very entertaining","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b27f49586a175bbebbde4280c415f10977511a72","amp;dn":"Sivaji+%5B2007%5D+Blue+Ray+%5B1080%5D+AC3+6ch+DTS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b27f49586a175bbebbde4280c415f10977511a72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,127,73,88,106,23,91,190,187,222,66,128,196,21,241,9,119,81,26,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
