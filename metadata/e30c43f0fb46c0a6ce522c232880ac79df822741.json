(^_^)\n\nThis comes on Showtime. I love this show so much! It is just AWESOME!!! (^_^) \n\nI am hooked and if you try it I am sure you will be too.\n\nI feel that everybody should try this show!!! (^_^) It is BAD-ASS! \n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0773262/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0773262/&lt;/a&gt;  \n\nIMDB rating 9.2/10 \n\nTaglines: America's favorite serial killer. \n\nGenres: Crime | Drama | Mystery | Thriller \n\nShow Nfo - A like-able Miami police forensics expert moonlights as a serial killer of criminals who he believes have escaped justice.   \n\nMore Nfo - Meet Dexter Morgan. By day he's a blood splatter pattern expert for the Miami Metro police department. But by night - he takes on an entirely different persona: serial killer. But Dexter isn't your average serial killer as he only kills people who fit a very prolific and precise &quot;moral code&quot; taught to him by his late father Harry (he didn't kill Harry, honest), and developed very thoroughly throughout each kill. While dealing with his daily activities and his boss, Sgt. Doakes, the one man who may or may not know the truth about his after-hours activities, he is given a friendly message by a guy referred to only as &quot;The Ice Truck Killer&quot; - a crime scene where there is no blood. This shocking discovery turns Dexter's world completely upside down. The Ice Truck Killer wants Dexter to play his game and Dexter is very eager to take on this cat-and-mouse chase throughout Miami.\n\nReview - Dexter is hilarious; it is easily the best new show on TV! Dark, dry humor crops up in the most unexpected places, and the settings and dialogue are laced with CSI's pseudo-scientific appeal. While the show may appear to treat standard morality as irreverent, it is actually an excellent study of humanity at its best -- and worse.\n\nThe character of Dexter, a disassociated, psychopathic serial killer, is somewhat reminiscent of Data, the android in the Star Trek series. Dexter is devoid of normal, human emotion, and has to learn behaviors by rote. Seeing the world through his eyes enables us to closely examine what is &quot;right&quot; and what is &quot;wrong.&quot; We have to pause and wonder about our own perception of reality.\n\nOverall, the show is a side-splitting outlet for the vigilante/serial killer/dysfunctional being in all of us. Well done!\n\n\nVideo Specs: \nVideo #0          : AVC at 400 Kbps\nAspect            : 480 x 272 (1.765) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nPlease seed when finished downloading and leave a comment, request, etc. And above all ENJOY! \n\nIf you would like to live chat or instant message me, here is one of my many contacts -  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;94f5faf3f1f8fdf7f0f1f9fbfaa2add4fcfbe0f9f5fdf8baf7fbbae1ff&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;  \n\nIf anyone would like any tv show, movie, music video, or yes, even XXX, for PSP or any other handheld device for that matter.
