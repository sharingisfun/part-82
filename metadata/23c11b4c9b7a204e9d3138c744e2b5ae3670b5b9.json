Max (no emotional sophisticate) becomes obsessed, mostly with Kira, but vaguely with his curious lack of conscience as well. Kira, fighting to win a job she hates and running aimless romantic loops, faces the precarious double challenge of choosing a next step and charting a course back to sanity. Good luck leading with your heart, when your heart is an utter emotional idiot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23c11b4c9b7a204e9d3138c744e2b5ae3670b5b9","amp;dn":"Sorry.Thanks.2009.DVDRip.XviD-SPRiNTER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23c11b4c9b7a204e9d3138c744e2b5ae3670b5b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,193,27,76,155,122,32,78,157,49,56,199,68,226,181,174,54,112,181,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
