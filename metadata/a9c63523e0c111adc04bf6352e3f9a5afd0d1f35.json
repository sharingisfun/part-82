Meditation is the route to that knowing. It is the methodology of the science of awareness.\n\nThe beauty of the inner science is that it enables whoever wants to explore and to experiment within, to do so alone. This eliminates dependence on an outer authority, the need to be affiliated with any organization and the obligation to accept a certain ideology. Once you understand the steps, you walk the walk in your own, individual way. Many meditative techniques require one to sit still and silent. But for most of us accumulated stress in our bodymind makes that difficult. Before we can hope to access our inner powerhouse of consciousness, we need to let go of our tensions.\nOsho Active Meditations have been scientifically designed by Osho over a period of time to enable us to consciously express and experience repressed feelings and emotions, and learn the knack of watching our habitual patterns in a new way\n\nThere are many different, even contradictory ideas, about what meditation is. Primary to the Osho approach is the need for the meditator to understand the nature of the mind, rather than fight with it.\n\nMost of us most of the time are run by, dominated by our thoughts or feelings. It follows that we tend to think we are those thoughts and feeling. Meditation is the state of simply being, just pure experiencing, with no interference from the body or mind. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a natural state but one which we have forgotten how to access.\n\nThe word meditation is also used for what is, more accurately, a meditation method. Meditative methods, techniques or devices are means by which to create an inner ambience that facilitates disconnecting from the bodymind so one can simply be. While initially it is helpful to put time aside to practice a structured meditation method, there are many techniques that are practiced within the context of oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s everyday life ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ at work, at leisure, alone and with others.\n\nMethods are needed only until the state of meditation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ of relaxed awareness, of consciousness and centering ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ has become not just a passing experience but as intrinsic to one as, say, breathing.\n\n\nSome Common Misconceptions\n\n\nMeditation isÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n1) Only for people who are on a spiritual search.\nThe benefits of meditation are manifold. Chief among them are the ability to relax and to be aware without effort. Useful tools for just about everyone!\n\n2) A practice to gain ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpeace of mind.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nPeace of mind is a contradiction in terms. By its very nature the mind is a chronic commentator. What you can discover through meditation is the knack of finding the distance between yourself and the commentary, so that the mind, with its constant circus of thoughts and emotions, no longer intrudes on your inherent state of silence. \n\n3) A mental discipline or effort to control or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the mind, to become more mindful.\nMeditation is neither a mental effort nor an attempt to control the mind. Effort and control involve tension, and tension is antithetical to the state of meditation. Besides, there is no need to control the mind, only to understand it and how it works. The meditator does not need to tame his mind, to become more mindful, but to grow more in consciousness.\n\n4) Focusing, concentrating or contemplating.\nFocusing, like concentrating is a narrowing of awareness. You concentrate on one object to the exclusion of everything else. By contrast, meditation is all-inclusive, your consciousness is expanded. The contemplator is focused on an object ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ perhaps a religious object, a photograph or on an inspiring aphorism. The meditator is simply aware, but not of anything in particular.\n\n5) A new experience.\nNot necessarily ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ sportsmen know this space, which they refer to as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe zone.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Artists know it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ through singing, painting, playing music. We can know it through gardening, playing with the kids, walking on the beach or making love. Even as children we may have had experiences of it. Meditation is a natural state and one that you have almost certainly tasted, although perhaps without knowing the name of the flavor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9c63523e0c111adc04bf6352e3f9a5afd0d1f35","amp;dn":"Osho+-+The+Enlightened+Mystic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9c63523e0c111adc04bf6352e3f9a5afd0d1f35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,198,53,35,224,193,17,173,192,75,246,53,46,63,154,90,253,13,31,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
