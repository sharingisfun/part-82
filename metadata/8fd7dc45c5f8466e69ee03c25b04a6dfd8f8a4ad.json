However his childhood was spent far from the      \n    glamour of Manhattan where he now lives.                  \n                                                               \n    Growing up in the small town of Aberfeldy, Scotland,      \n    Alan knew very little about his family history. With     \n    his parents now both in their seventies, he feels it's    \n    time to see if he can clear up one big question            \n    lingering in the family's past.                           \n                                                             \n    The mystery relates to Alan's maternal grandfather,       \n    Thomas Darling. A career soldier who spent most of his     \n    life away from home serving in the army, he died, aged    \n    just 35, in mysterious circumstances in Malaysia.        \n                                                              \n    Alan begins by visiting his mother Mary in Dundee, to      \n    see what she can tell him about her father. Mary has      \n    few memories of him, but she has some documents          \n    relating to his military career and a medal he won in     \n    the Second World War. She hopes these clues will get       \n    Alan started in his search.                               \n                                                             \n    Alan travels to France where he finds out about his       \n    grandfather's extraordinary bravery during the             \n    evacuation of Dunkirk - he's thrilled by his              \n    grandfather's medal-winning exploits.                    \n                                                              \n    Eventually Alan's journey takes him to Malaysia where      \n    he discovers the shocking story of how his grandfather    \n    really died and makes one last moving discovery about    \n    the lasting impact his grandfather made on the village    \n    where he was stationed in the months leading up to his     \n    death.                                                    \n                                                             \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fd7dc45c5f8466e69ee03c25b04a6dfd8f8a4ad","amp;dn":"Who.Do.You.Think.You.Are.UK.Alan.Cumming.S07E09.720p.HDTV.x264-S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fd7dc45c5f8466e69ee03c25b04a6dfd8f8a4ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,215,220,69,197,248,70,110,105,238,3,194,91,4,166,223,216,248,164,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
