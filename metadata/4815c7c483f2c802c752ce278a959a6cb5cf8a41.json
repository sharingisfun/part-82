The production of food overall has more\ndrastically changed since that time than the several\nthousand years prior. Controlled primarily by a handful\nof multinational corporations, the global food\nproduction business - with an emphasis on the business\n- has as its unwritten goals production of large\nquantities of food at low direct inputs (most often\nsubsidized) resulting in enormous profits, which in turn\nresults in greater control of the global supply of food\nsources within these few companies. Health and safety\n(of the food itself, of the animals produced themselves,\nof the workers on the assembly lines, and of the\nconsumers actually eating the food) are often overlooked\nby the companies, and are often overlooked by government\nin an effort to provide cheap food regardless of these\nnegative consequences. Many of the changes are based on\nadvancements in science and technology, but often have\nnegative side effects. The answer that the companies\nhave come up with is to throw more science at the\nproblems to bandage the issues but not the root causes.\nThe global food supply may be in crisis with lack of\nbiodiversity, but can be changed on the demand side of\nthe equation.\n\nRELEASE NOTES\n\nKiira Korpi ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4815c7c483f2c802c752ce278a959a6cb5cf8a41","amp;dn":"Food.Inc.2008.LiMiTED.DOCU.PAL.DVDR-TXF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4815c7c483f2c802c752ce278a959a6cb5cf8a41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,21,199,196,131,242,200,2,199,82,206,39,138,149,154,108,181,207,138,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
