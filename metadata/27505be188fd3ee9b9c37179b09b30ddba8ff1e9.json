Now, MELTDOWN traces the stories of the bankers who crashed the world, the leaders who struggled to save itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the ordinary families who got crushed.\n\nThe CBCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Terence McKenna takes viewers behind the headlines and behind the scenesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½into the backrooms of the highest levels of governments and financial institutions from Wall Street to Dubai to ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and reveals the backstabbing and the tension as the world comes dangerously close to another Great Depression.\n\nMELTDOWNÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cast of characters includes Geraint Anderson, a.k.a. City Boy, a hippie-turned-stockbroker in England who reveals the dirty secrets of high finance; Dick Fuld, the former CEO of Lehman Brothers, who boasted that he would rip out and eat his enemiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ hearts, but watched his own empire collapse; and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the self-styled CEO of Dubai Inc., who built a real estate empire that turned out to be largely a mirage.\n\nViewers will also meet desperate homeowners in California, disillusioned autoworkers at the end of the line in Ontario, and furious workers in France who shocked the world by kidnapping their own bosses. To date, no major banking, regulatory or government figures have been convicted of any wrongdoing.\n\nPart 3\nPaying the Price\nThe victims of the meltdown fight back. In Iceland, protestors force a government to fall. In Canada, ripped off autoworkers occupy their plant. And in France, furious union members kidnap their bosses.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 419 MiB for 44mn 59s 65ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 159 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 352 (1.773) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 129 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27505be188fd3ee9b9c37179b09b30ddba8ff1e9","amp;dn":"Doc+Zone.Meltdown.23.Sep.2010.30f4.HDTV.XviD-Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27505be188fd3ee9b9c37179b09b30ddba8ff1e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,80,91,225,136,253,62,233,185,195,113,121,176,155,48,221,186,143,241,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
