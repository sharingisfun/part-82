There is one little dream of a beautiful drum - Rub-a-dub! it goeth; There is one little dream of a big sugar-plum, And lo! thick and fast the other dreams come Of popguns that bang, and tin tops that hum, And a trumpet that bloweth! And dollies peep out of those wee little dreams With laughter and singing; And boats go a-floating on silvery streams, And the stars peek-a-boo with their own misty gleams, And up, up, and up, where the Mother Moon beams, The fairies go winging! Would you dream all these dreams that are tiny and fleet?....................","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e0eb9ded4df261f9bf302e1cc1c7d178fc40a95","amp;dn":"Love-Songs+of+Childhood-MANTESH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e0eb9ded4df261f9bf302e1cc1c7d178fc40a95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,14,185,222,212,223,38,31,155,243,2,225,204,28,125,23,143,196,10,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
