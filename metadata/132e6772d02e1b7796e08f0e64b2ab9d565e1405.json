Jerry Hicks have published hundreds of books, audio recordings and videos, and have conducted up to 60 workshops a year. Their work is derived from the teachings of &quot;Non-Physical Source Energy&quot; whom they refer to as &quot;Abraham&quot;.\n\nThe Teachings of Abraham are based on a universal principle called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions play, and they illuminate and inform every aspect of our experience.\n\n&quot;The thrill of the ride is carved out of the contrast. Without the contrast, you could not decide.&quot;\n\nAnswers and inspiration from the Non-Physical entity Abraham - whom Esther calls &quot;infinite intelligence&quot; and Jerry refers to as &quot;the purest form of love I've ever encountered.&quot;\n\n\nThank you to all who participated to make this possible!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:132e6772d02e1b7796e08f0e64b2ab9d565e1405","amp;dn":"Abraham-Hicks+2010-03-13+4-hour+Video+Caribbean+Cruise","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"132e6772d02e1b7796e08f0e64b2ab9d565e1405","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,46,103,114,208,46,27,119,150,224,143,14,100,178,171,157,86,94,20,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
