This act was to win a school competition with a combination of original songs and covers from Uriah Heep, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. A demo was recorded before the addition of drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg and bassist Markus GroÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸kopf as a name change ensued to Second Hell (Deu). Tracks written during this period such as \\\\\\&quot;Gorgon\\\\\\&quot;, \\\\\\&quot;Phantoms Of Death\\\\\\&quot;, \\\\\\&quot;Murder\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;Victim Of Fate\\\\\\&quot; would later come to attention on the debut Helloween album. This period also saw the birth of the latter day Gamma Ray track \\\\\\&quot;Heading For Tomorrow\\\\\\&quot;.\n\n\nBirth dates:\nPiet Sielck (14th November 1963, Hamburg, Germany)\nJens Arnsted a.k.a.
