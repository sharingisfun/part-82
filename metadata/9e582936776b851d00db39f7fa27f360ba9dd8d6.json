As Canadians continue to push the idea\nthat Hip Hop isn't dead...It lives in the North\nPeter Jackson always believed that Hip Hop was his life and was\ndetermined to convince other to believe in his dream as much as he did\nJackson knew that if he was to survive in this industry he was going to\nhave to take to the pavement himself to make it happen. Today he is not\njust an artist who has recorded hundreds of songs, or toured as the\nsupporting artist for legendary rappers, he also boasts a promotions\ncompany and a clothing line. Peter Jackson and his team 90Nickel are not\njust a group of rapper they are a local Hip-Hop franchise\n\nPeter Jackson has appeared on over 50 mixed tapes in North America\nworking with names such as, DJ Rated R, Potent Product, DJ Diggz, DJ\nDollah , and more. He released his own mixed tape titled, Business as\nUsual hosted by DJ G-Spot of Shadyville DJ fame in 2007. Jackson quickly\nfollowed it up with two more compilations, Fly Society, featuring fellow\n90Nickle member, and Hustler's Tears, both hosted by DJ Bedz, the Denver\nNuggets official DJ, and Denver, Colorados Shadyville DJ. In 2008,\nJackson began working with executive producer Sheldon Moore, who has\nyears of experience working with artists such as Citizen Kaine, K-OS,\nBig Pun, Jahiem. Together they produced and released Peter Jackson's\nfirst EP titled, The Introduction, with features from Jmore, Emmerson\nJust Brooks, Toya Lexus and Royce da 5'9. The first single from the EP,\nCome on Over, featuring Jmore is currently receiving radio rotation\nacross Canada after being picked up by Toronto's Flow 93.5 FM\n\nThis young artist is tenacious and determined. His lyrics are insightful\nand he is willing to challenge the boundaries of the Rap and Hip Hop\nindustry we know today. At times his rhymes are hard and unapologetic,\nbut he can also captivate a club with a beat and an unforgettable hook\n\nSUPPORT THE ARTIST'S &amp; INDEPENDANT NAMES\n\nCR BRINGS YOU ONLY THE BEST\nAND WE ALWAYS DO\n2010\n\nTRACKLIST\n\n01.In My Life  Feat.
