Authors and editors often assume - incorrectly - that readers are familiar with all the terms in professional literature. With over 4,000 definitions and 50 contributing authors, this unique comprehensive dictionary helps scientists to use terminology correctly and to understand papers, articles, and books in which physics-related terms appear.\n\n- crcpress.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:748914a4e7bad353181507a7ce0ccdc2f7cf72a4","amp;dn":"Dictionary+of+Geophyiscs%2C+Astrophyics%2C+and+Astronomy.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"748914a4e7bad353181507a7ce0ccdc2f7cf72a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,137,20,164,231,186,211,83,24,21,7,167,206,12,205,194,247,207,114,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
