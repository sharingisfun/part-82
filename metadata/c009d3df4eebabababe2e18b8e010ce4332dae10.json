He is glad to be back in his role as a dominant warrior and back in the arms of his true love. Yet, Tarl finds that his name on Gor has been tainted, his city defiled, and all those he loves have been made into outcasts. He is no longer in the position of a proud warrior, but an outlaw for whom the simplest answers must come at a high price. He wonders why the Priest Kings have called him back to Gor, and whether it is only to render him powerless.\n\nThe first novel in John Norman's Counter-Earth Series, &quot;Tarnsman of Gor,&quot; owed a debt to &quot;A Princess of Mars,&quot; the first John Carter novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Both of the second novels in these series begin the same way, with the hero finally able to return to the distant planet where they can begin to search for the great love of their life. But after the beginning of &quot;Outlaw of Gor&quot; Norman abandons the parallels to Burroughs and starts to build on the elements introduced in the first novel to create his own unique world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c009d3df4eebabababe2e18b8e010ce4332dae10","amp;dn":"Gor+-+02+-+Outlaw+of+Gor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c009d3df4eebabababe2e18b8e010ce4332dae10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,9,211,223,78,235,171,171,171,226,225,139,142,1,12,228,51,45,174,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
