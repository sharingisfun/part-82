Truly excellent music in this album. My favorites are Control Room (O6 Mix), In The Now, and of course, You Gotta Tap (from the original video). The artist of this album isn't from a big record label, so please, if you like the music, go to the site and buy the darn CD. I did. http://www.AudioBody.com\n\nRipped with Exact Audio Copy with AccurateRip (no tracks present in database though), included a CUE and a LOG. Encoded with dbPowerAmp Music Converter. Tagged with Tag&amp;Rename from FreeDB source. Cover scanned in Photoshop with my Canon LiDE 30. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51ad0a564cb730b58bba14a28c75730c28f0d9f9","amp;dn":"AudioBody+-+Version+2.2+%28Sound.+Motion.+Theater.%29+%5BEAC%2BCUE%2BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51ad0a564cb730b58bba14a28c75730c28f0d9f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,173,10,86,76,183,48,181,139,186,20,162,140,117,115,12,40,240,217,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
