Only the 5:th session is with all gears and full braking.\n\nI pretty much choose the 3:rd gear around the track, sometimes 2:nd to practice &quot;pickup&quot; with a bit more drive after some corners. Hard braking only if i had to pass someone on the straight beore the corner.\n\nLap times for me was around 1.30 under those conditions. The fast guys do this track at around 1.15 and the race guys is down to 1.05 or so.\n\nThe videoclips are probably extremely boring and uninteresting unless you were on the track yourself and ended up ahead or behind my bike...\n\nPlease help me seed the files you download!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2e98c4cfc8a0dbd34273838fa1d89d79487279e","amp;dn":"SMC+och+California+Superbike+School+kurser+Geller%C3%A5sen+2010-07-08","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2e98c4cfc8a0dbd34273838fa1d89d79487279e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,233,140,76,252,138,13,189,52,39,56,56,250,29,137,215,148,135,39,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
