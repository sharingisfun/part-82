If we see a rerun airing\n\tof unreleased eps from series we try to get it. If the\n\tshow is really old and the hope of finding the original\n\trelease is gone, we try to fix that too with iNTERNALs. \n\t\n\tThis of course makes our releases a bit random and some\n\tmight think we are mad but there will be a reason behind\n\tthe madness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d41c742d1a9cb332630aca72672e9baaa45e4762","amp;dn":"Tosh.0.S02E04.REAL.HDTV.XviD-MiNDTHEGAP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d41c742d1a9cb332630aca72672e9baaa45e4762","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,28,116,45,26,156,179,50,99,10,202,114,103,46,155,170,164,94,71,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
