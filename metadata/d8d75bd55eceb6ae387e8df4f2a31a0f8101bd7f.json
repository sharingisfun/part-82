Max is the host of On the Edge, a program of news and analysis and he also hosts Keiser Report, a financial tabloid. Keiser formerly hosted The Oracle with Max Keiser  on BBC World News. Keiser correctly predicted the 2008 collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that sub-prime mortgage-backed securities would be the cause of the economic crisis beginning in 2008, and also predicted the banker sabotage of Iceland's economy.\n[from about 7:00 into hour 3 through the end of the broadcast]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.maxkeiser.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.maxkeiser.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n[several minutes of Ted Anderson doing a live commercial for Midas Resources in the 2nd half of hour 1]\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
