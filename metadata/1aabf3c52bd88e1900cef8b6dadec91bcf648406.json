cryptic  note  for  his  wife  Lara  Darcie  (Nicholle   Tom),\n        suggesting  that  the death  of  his little  sister  years ago\n        wasn't really an accident - and he may have even had a hand in\n        it. Driven by the need  to know more about her  husband's dark\n        past and the secret that led him to want to end his life, Lara\n        goes back to the small town where Jason was raised. There, she\n        finds his father now senile and in a nursing home, leaving her\n        with only  Jason's younger  brother Grady  (Philip Riccio)  to\n        help her unravel the mysterious confession in Justin's note.\n\n        But  what  Lara  doesn't  know  is  that  Grady  suffers  from\n        Dissociative  Identity  Disorder (formerly  known  as Multiple\n        Personality  Disorder).  Lara's   probe  into  the   brothers'\n        chilling  childhood  causes  one  of  Grady's  more aggressive\n        personalities to take control,  eager to protect his  family's\n        secret and willing to stop at nothing - even murder - to  keep\n        the past buried.\n\n        As Lara gets closer to the truth, she puts herself and another\n        woman, Candy (Cinthia Burke), an attractive but antisocial  ex\n        -con  that Grady  often confesses  his problems  to, in  grave\n        danger. Realising that Grady's most twisted personality is  in\n        control and after them, Lara must save herself and Candy  from\n        suffering the same fate as Grady's sister...\n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n            Nicholle Tom             ....
