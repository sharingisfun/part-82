He picks his team depending on which tasks need to be done. One thing is vital on an Impossible Mission: the mission must be carried out in entire secrecy, often relying on high-tech equipment and elaborate deceptions. An update of the classic 1966 series, featuring a great deal of high-tech gadgetry.
