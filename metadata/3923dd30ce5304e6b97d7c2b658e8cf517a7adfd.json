This is the same episode as:\n\tTosh.0.S02E04.HDTV.XviD-aAF\n\t\n\tInitially I was just going to make iNTERNALs for the \n\tarchives but on a closer inspection the old rips has issues\n\tat the commercial breaks due to what probably is a shitty\n\ttool being used for editing. A few seconds is missing at \n\tboth the first and second cut point. Well, third too, but \n\tthere is just a logo as intro so nothing of value is missing. \n\tIt is also causing video to glitch quite severly. (No, I'm \n\tnot talking about the added distortion in the graphics of \n\tthe show.)  \n\n\tSample included from both rips for an easy comparison. \n\t\n\tI haven't seen these issues on later pre's from aAF so \n\tI assume they became aware of it. Keep it up!\n\t\n\tINFO:\n\t\n\tMINDTHEGAP is living up to its groupname. We do mind all\n\tthe gaps in archives out there. If we see a rerun airing\n\tof unreleased eps from series we try to get it. If the\n\tshow is really old and the hope of finding the original\n\trelease is gone, we try to fix that too with iNTERNALs. \n\t\n\tThis of course makes our releases a bit random and some\n\tmight think we are mad but there will be a reason behind\n\tthe madness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3923dd30ce5304e6b97d7c2b658e8cf517a7adfd","amp;dn":"Tosh.0.S02E05.PROPER.HDTV.XviD-MiNDTHEGAP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3923dd30ce5304e6b97d7c2b658e8cf517a7adfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,35,221,48,206,83,4,230,185,125,124,43,101,142,140,245,23,167,173,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
