This 1965 high adventure stars Frank Sinatra as\nthe leader of a mass escape from a World War II POW camp in Italy. That\nmission accomplished, Old Blue Eyes has sundry adventures camouflaging the\nfreed men as German soldiers, trying to fool the Gestapo, and finally doing\nbattle with enemy planes and ground troops while trying to get a hijacked\ntrain through a blocked tunnel. Sinatra is in great form and director Mark\nRobson handles the endless chain of action set-pieces with panache. A great\npulse-quickener. --Tom Keogh\n\n-- &quot;Von Ryan's express&quot; stands out among the most exciting, explosive and\nmoving of epic war films, not only because its vibrant finale in the middle\nof those arresting Swiss landscapes, it also explores, step by step, the\nhard lessons in leadership Sinatra's Colonel Ryan must learn in leading\na group of escaped prisoners across enemy-held territory.\n...One of the most relevant war films ever made.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c4d44a34d3d91192223f717a149d4fb32b22ec4","amp;dn":"Von+Ryan%5C%27s+Express+1965+XviD+100%25+ENG+FRE+ESP+Honeyko+anamorphi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c4d44a34d3d91192223f717a149d4fb32b22ec4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,77,68,163,77,61,145,25,34,35,247,23,161,73,212,251,50,178,46,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
