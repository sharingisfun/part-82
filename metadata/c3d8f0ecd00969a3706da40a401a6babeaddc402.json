From his initial denial to the full declaration of guilt, the fifth estate deciphers one of the most compelling and distressing confessions in Canadian criminal history with the help of people who know the art of interrogation better than anyone else. For many months, the fifth estate has been following the story of Russell Williams and now is able to piece it together from the early clues to the final confession.\n\nFile Information\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 59mn 38s 545ms\nSource            : CBC SD\nCodec             : XviD\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 954 Kbps\nAspect            : 576 x 336 (1.714) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 123 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3d8f0ecd00969a3706da40a401a6babeaddc402","amp;dn":"the_fifth_estate.S36E05.22.Oct.2010.PDTV.XviD-Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3d8f0ecd00969a3706da40a401a6babeaddc402","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,216,240,236,208,9,105,163,112,109,164,10,64,26,107,171,234,221,196,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
