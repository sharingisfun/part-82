The only problem with this recording is that I wanted to hear more of Evan Carawan's great hammer dulcimer playing. I would however buy it just for the first track alone, that being Two Steps Back. That being said, this CD delivers on the tunes - there are 25 and each one is wonderfully performed.  \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp \n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7d51f473785beda0182a3023a4110e14b77c1bb","amp;dn":"Atomic+City+Rhythm+Rascals...Atomic+City+Rhythm+Rascals%282001%29%5BFL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7d51f473785beda0182a3023a4110e14b77c1bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,213,31,71,55,133,190,218,1,130,163,2,58,65,16,225,75,119,193,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
