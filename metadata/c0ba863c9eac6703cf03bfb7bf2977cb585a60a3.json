Saiyuki is such magic.\n\nNguyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªn LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âª's fifth album for ACT is performed by LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âª himself (guitars), Mieko\nMiyazaki (koto and vocals) and Prabhu Edouard (tablas, percussion and vocals)\nand as you might guess, there's a strong Indo jazz and trad Japanese elements\nwith ambient, modal and Offramp themes throw into the genre mix.\n\nThe opener 'Sweet Ganesh' sets the tone but on the meditative groove but the\naddition of Hariprasad Chaurasia on bassuri flute on three tracks almost steels\nthe show (erm, CD); 'Autumn Wind' is sublime (think Yusek Lateef in Nepalese\ntemple looking down on the world).\n\nThe other two are 'Mina Zuki' and 'Sangam' and both all are supeb. 'Mina Zuki'\nis more uptempo with a bit of a Greek Island influence along with Mieko on top\nform on this one. 'Sangam' even includes some chorus vocals but it's one for\nguitar heads but all four of them get to solo - this is possibly the most\ninstant track on the album.\n\nBut it's not all about Nariprasad's flute, as a trio 'Mayur' and 'Hen Ho' are\nlike a modern indo-jazz fusion (of a McLaughlin/Santana period); it's so post\njazz-nodding there should be a Big Chill/Womad gig next year at least. And\nwhilst at it, 'Nanae Goromo' takes the concept to the extended prog extreme and\n'Azur' is Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence 'revisit' in a Saiyuki vibe.\n\nThe title 'Saiyuki' is taken from a 16th Century novel by Wu Cheng'en and it\nmeans &quot;Journey To The West&quot;. And the music is like that as these guys are so\nopen, 'Izanagi Isanam' even sounds a little risquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© on the vocal introduction\n(would Osunlade love to remix this one? I think so).\n\nThis is a absolutely fantastically original album and all from Kevin Le Grand to\nJez Nelson to Nihal to Pathaan to Gilles Peterson, they all should be on this\none as Saiuki is so now and what with Portico Quartet and the Bei Bei and Shawn\nLee collaboration, this is hitting the crossover world/spiritual jazz in all the\nright places. This is a truly 'joyful encounter'.\n\n\nReviewed:\n~~~~~~~\n- Nguyen Le - Saiyuki\n- (ACT) Cat.
