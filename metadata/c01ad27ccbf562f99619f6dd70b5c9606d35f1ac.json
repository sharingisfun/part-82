Both albums are full of anger, bravado, revenge and guilt, precisely the types of emotions which fueled Costello and Jackson. On &quot;(No More) Dancin' In The Street,&quot; Hiatt admonishes the mindless disco hordes with &quot;Martha &amp; The Vandellas showed you how to do as you please/Now all of you idiots are dancin' with The Bee Gees,&quot; but back then no one was listening. &quot;Pink Bedroom&quot; finds our hero railing against a prima donna whose world is filled with short shorts and import records and &quot;The Night That Kenny Died&quot; contains some pointed observations about a classmate with some particularly disgusting habits, like picking his nose. Not the type of material which seems destined for the charts, but Hiatt and his... band have created some very engaging, hooky pop on these two albums which, of course, died a quick death in the stores. Worth taking a chance on, although for my money, there's no risk involved. You'll love it! \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c01ad27ccbf562f99619f6dd70b5c9606d35f1ac","amp;dn":"John+Hiatt...Slug+Line-Two+Bit+Monsters%281993%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c01ad27ccbf562f99619f6dd70b5c9606d35f1ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,26,210,124,203,245,98,249,150,25,246,221,112,181,201,96,109,53,241,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
