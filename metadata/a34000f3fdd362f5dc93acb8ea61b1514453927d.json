Dresden unravels otherworldly schemes and crimes and does battle with the forces of darkness, all while keeping his true activities veiled from Lt. Connie Murphy (Valerie Cruz) of the Chicago Police Department.\n\nThe governing body that supervises wizards is called the High Council. The Council enforces the rules and makes certain that nobody in the mundane world ever knows what's going on in the supernatural world. In Chicago, the Council's Warden is Morgan (Conrad Coates). \nMorgan is Harry's probation officer. Five years ago Harry used black magic to kill his uncle Justin Morningway. \nThe Council ruled that Harry did it in self-defense, but Morgan suspects otherwise.\nHe would be only too happy to catch Harry in another transgression. \n\nGEGEVENS:\ncategory: Fantasy \\ Horror serie\nquality: tv rip\nLanguage: English Dutch subtitles\nyear:2007\ncodec: XVID\nbitrate: 1114 Kbps\nSize: 608 X 336\nSound format: lame mp3 16-bit\nINFO:\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486657/\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dresden_Files_%28TV_series%29\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nENJOY THE SHOW :) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a34000f3fdd362f5dc93acb8ea61b1514453927d","amp;dn":"THE+DRESDEN+FILES+SEIZOEN+1%282007%29NL+Sub+NLT-Release+%28divx%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a34000f3fdd362f5dc93acb8ea61b1514453927d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,64,0,243,253,211,98,245,220,147,172,184,234,97,177,81,68,83,146,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
