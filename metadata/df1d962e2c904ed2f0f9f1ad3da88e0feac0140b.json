The not-so-kid-savvy bachelors stumble in their efforts to take care of the twins, leading to one debacle after another, and perhaps to a new-found understanding of whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really important in life.\n\n\n\n\n----------------------- \n x   x           x   x\n  x x             x x\n   x  - Jaguar -   x\n  x x             x x\n x   x           x   x\n-----------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df1d962e2c904ed2f0f9f1ad3da88e0feac0140b","amp;dn":"Old+Dogs.DvdRip+2010.Xvid++%7C+X-Jaguar-X+%7C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df1d962e2c904ed2f0f9f1ad3da88e0feac0140b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,29,150,46,44,144,78,210,240,249,241,173,61,168,142,15,234,192,20,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
