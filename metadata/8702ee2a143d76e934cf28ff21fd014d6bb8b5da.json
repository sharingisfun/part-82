Joined by his personal friend Bill Paxton (TITANIC) and a team of the world's foremost history and marine experts, Cameron journeys back to the site of his greatest inspiration -- the legendary wreck of the Titanic.\n\nDuring the voyage, you will explore the entire ship, deck by deck, room by room, encountering mysteries that have remained hidden for almost a century. Revolutionary underwater robots were designed and built solely for the purpose of allowing the explorers to peer deep into the remains of the once great ship and bring those surreal and haunting images back to the surface.\n\nLoaded with never-before-seen footage, revealing interviews.This unprecedented motion picture event is a must-own companion for anyone who loves TITANIC. \n\n\n\n\n\nGuest : Bill Paxton\n===================\n\n\nProduced &amp; Directed by: James Cameron\n=====================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Ghosts Of The Abyss\nYear.................:    2003\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:31:35\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    MPEG Layer-3\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    608x336\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1068 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    2 (External English + Hearing Impaired)\nFile Size:...........:    699 MB\nFPS..................:    23.976000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    18 April 2003 \n\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0297144/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0297144/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         **** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8702ee2a143d76e934cf28ff21fd014d6bb8b5da","amp;dn":"Ghosts+Of+The+Abyss-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8702ee2a143d76e934cf28ff21fd014d6bb8b5da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,2,238,42,20,61,118,233,52,207,40,255,33,253,1,77,107,184,181,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
