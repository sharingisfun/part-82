Mark really pours on the drinks, and provides     \n   some family rock band entertainment. His menu goes down well, with    \n     a very competitive Mark doing a hard sell at the table. But he      \n     also tries to pull the wool over their eyes, passing off store      \n   bought food as homemade. His little white lies start to add up. Is    \n     everyone too merry to notice or will he get his just desserts?      \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                \n             \n                                                                           \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                            \n                                                                    \n                                             \n                                              \n                                                      \n                                                         \n                                    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n                \n                                                                  \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                     Enjoy the final of this series!                     \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                        \n                                                                      \n                                                                        \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                  \n                \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                          \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                            \n                                                                           \n                                                     \n                                      \n                                              \n                                                     \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                             \n                                                                         \n                \n                                                                   \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n           Shell &amp;
