Her music blends rock, folk and pop into one mainstream sound. She has won nine Grammy Awards.\n\nShe has performed with the Rolling Stones and has sung duets with Mick Jagger,[1] Michael Jackson, Eric Clapton, Luciano Pavarotti, John Mellencamp, Kid Rock, Michelle Branch and Sting among others, and appeared on backing vocals for Tina Turner and Don Henley. Crow has released seven studio albums, two compilations, and a live album, as well as contributing many songs to film soundtracks. She has sold 16 million albums in United States and 35 million albums worldwide and her newest album, 100 Miles from Memphis, was released on July 20, 2010.[2] Crow has won nine Grammy Awards in her career. Recently she appeared on NBC's 30 Rock, ABC's Cougar Town and Disney Channel's Hannah Montana Forever. [/quote]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled First Album 1992\n\n\nIn 1992, Crow recorded her first attempt at her debut album with Phil Collins' producer Hugh Padgham. The self-titled debut album was slated to be released on September 22, 1992, but was ultimately rejected by her label.[10] However, a handful of cassette copies of the album were leaked along with press folders to be used for album publicity. This album has been widely dispersed via file sharing networks and fan trading over the years. In the meantime, Crow's songs were recorded by major artists such as Celine Dion and Wynonna Judd.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nNear Me\nWhen Love is Over\nYou Want it All\nHundreds of Tears\nThe Last Time\nBorrowed Time\nAll Kinds of People\nFathers Son\nWhat Does it Matter\nIndian Summer\nI Will Walk With You\nLove You Blind\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday Night Music Club 1993\n\n\nTuesday Night Music Club is the debut album from American singer/songwriter Sheryl Crow, released in August 3, 1993. The lead single &quot;Run, Baby, Run&quot; was not particularly successful. However, the album gained attention after the success of the third single, &quot;All I Wanna Do,&quot; based on the Wyn Cooper poem &quot;Fun&quot; and co-written by David Baerwald, Bill Bottrell, Sheryl Crow, and Kevin Gilbert. The single eventually reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100, propelling the album to number three in the US Billboard 200 album charts, selling over 5.3 million units there as of January 2008 [1][2]. On the UK Album Chart, Tuesday Night Music Club reached #8.\n\nIt is listed as one of 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die[2]\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Run, Baby, Run&quot; (David Baerwald, Bill Bottrell, Crow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53\n2.\t&quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; (Baerwald, Bottrell, Crow, Kevin Gilbert, David Ricketts) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:10\n3.\t&quot;Strong Enough&quot; (Baerwald, Bottrell, Crow, Gilbert, Brian MacLeod, Ricketts) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n4.\t&quot;Can't Cry Anymore&quot; (Bottrell, Crow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n5.\t&quot;Solidify&quot; (Baerwald, Bottrell, Crow, Gilbert, Kevin Hunter, MacLeod, Ricketts) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n6.\t&quot;The Na-Na Song&quot; (Baerwald, Bottrell, Crow, Gilbert, MacLeod, Ricketts) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12\n7.\t&quot;No One Said It Would Be Easy&quot; (Bottrell, Crow, Gilbert, Dan Schwartz) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:29\n8.\t&quot;What I Can Do For You&quot; (Baerwald, Crow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n9.\t&quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; (Baerwald, Bottrell, Wyn Cooper, Crow, Gilbert) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32\n10.\t&quot;We Do What We Can&quot; (Bottrell, Crow, Gilbert, Schwartz) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:38\n11.\t&quot;I Shall Believe&quot; (Bottrell, Crow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun Baby Run 1995 \n\n\n&quot;Run Baby Run&quot; is a 1995 single by singer Sheryl Crow from the album Tuesday Night Music Club released by A&amp;M Records. It was originally released as a first European single from the album both in 1993 and 1994. It failed to chart in 1993 but it reached a no. 92 position in the UK in 1994 and was a minor radio hit in several other countries.\n&quot;Run Baby Run&quot; was released for a third time after the success of &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; and &quot;Strong Enough. It reached no. 24 in the UK charts in July of 1995.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\nReach Around Jerk\nCanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Cry Anymore\nRun Baby Run\nThe Na Na Song\nStrong Enough\nNo One Said it Would Be Easy\nLeaving Las Vegas\nWhat Can I Do For You\nI Shall Believe\n\n\n\n\n\nSheryl Crow 1996\n\n\nSheryl Crow is the second album by American singer Sheryl Crow, released in 1996 (see 1996 in music).

As of February 2008, it has sold 880,344 copies in the UK.\n\nThe song &quot;Love Is a Good Thing&quot; contains the lyrics &quot;Watch out sister, watch out brother, watch our children while they kill each other with a gun they bought at Wal-Mart discount stores&quot; (in criticism of Wal-Mart's gun sales policy). For this reason, sales of the album were banned at Wal-Mart stores.[3]\n\n&quot;Redemption Day&quot; was covered by Johnny Cash on his second posthumous record, American VI: Ain't No Grave. [4]\n\nSheryl Crow is featured in Vital Pop: 50 Essential Pop Albums list by Slant magazine. The album also made the Village Voice Pazz and Jop poll at number 26 and Mojo named it the 39th best album of 1996. British magazine Q named Sheryl Crow one of their 90 favorite albums of the 90s. Rolling Stone also selected it as one of the essential albums of that decade in 1999, while naming the self-titled effort the 44th greatest album of all time by a female artist in 2002.[5] In 2008, Entertainment Weekly magazine placed the album at number 39 in their list of Top 100 Best Albums of the past 25 years.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Maybe Angels&quot; (Sheryl Crow, Bill Bottrell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:56\n2.\t&quot;A Change Would Do You Good&quot; (Crow, Brian MacLeod, Jeff Trott) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n3.\t&quot;Home&quot; (Crow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:51\n4.\t&quot;Sweet Rosalyn&quot; (Crow, Trott) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n5.\t&quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot; (Crow, Trott) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:23\n6.\t&quot;Redemption Day&quot; (Crow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n7.\t&quot;Hard to Make a Stand&quot; (Bottrell, R.S.

The main beneficiaries are Tim Smith's amplified-acoustic rhythm parts and Jim Bogios' drums, and in particular the drums receive excellent definition where they had sounded as dull thuds and crashes previously. The balance between Sheryl's vocals, the backing vocals of the guitarists and the drummer and the instruments as a whole is superb, as good as any studio recording I have heard. \n\nMore subjectively, this captures a well-rehearsed, energetic band at peak performance and in command of a broad rock vocabulary. &quot;A Change Would Do You Good&quot; sounds progressively better since its studio release, the best performance on _Live in Central Park_ and the hands-down rocker of the show at Budokan. As an inside joke for fans of hers who share her Sixties favorites, the song begins as a faithful if transposed nod to the Who's &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot; - perfect, now that I've heard it - and ends with one verse and chorus of &quot;I Can't Explain.&quot; The band nails it, especially Bogios' simon-pure reproduction of Keith Moon's work and Sheryl's perfect, snarling evocation of Roger Daltrey. The slower songs in her catalog hit just as hard as the rockers, and this marks the first time &quot;Home,&quot; probably her most sadly beautiful song, appears in a live recording available on CD (you'd have to buy her 1999 DVD before now). \n\nHowever, I hope this is the second and last time &quot;Strong Enough&quot; appears on one of her live albums. I skip that track almost as quickly as &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; on any Rush live album - it's on every last damn one of them, and it wore out its welcome on the studio release. \n\nIn short, _Live at Budokan_ is her best live album of the two released, and has her best performances bar none of the Lilith Fair stuff, the DVD, or other collaborations I have heard. While it doesn't capture all of her strongest songs in one album, no one CD could, and it comes closer than any album produced yet to summarizing her appeal as a live performer. It would also be an excellent buy for someone who wants a best-of compilation, until her label releases one. \n\nTracks: \n\nSteve McQueen \nEveryday Is a Winding Road\nMy Favorite Mistake\nCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢mon CÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢mon\nStrong Enough\nIf It Makes You Happy\nThe Difficult Kind\nA Change Would Do You Good\nHome\nWeather Channel\nAll I Wanna Do\nSoak up The Sun\nThere Goes the Neighborhood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Very Best Of 2003\n\n\nThe Very Best of Sheryl Crow is a greatest hits album by American singer/songwriter Sheryl Crow, released in 2003 (see 2003 in music).

Crow told Billboard in the summer of 2007 that the song &quot;is very environmentally conscious, in the tradition of Bob Dylan.&quot; The single ended up being a radio airplay release only and from that &quot;Love Is Free&quot; was confirmed to be the second single from the album, to be released in early 2008.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ\tI'm really encouraging artists to write about what's going on, because we seem to be very distracted by some lightweight topics. I think it's time to start writing about the reality of what's around us.\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nIn additional comments on her Web site, Crow describes the single as &quot;an every way a desperate cry for understanding. Perhaps it is even a battle song in the face of fear.&quot;\n\nThe album is said by critics and fans to be a fairly political album. &quot;This is the most honest record I've ever made. It's about being forced to wake up,&quot; says Crow.\n\nThe second single is &quot;Love Is Free&quot; which, in Crow's own words, is &quot;inspired by New Orleans. What struck me about it is the stoicism of the New Orleans people, they are very spiritually based. You can see it in their eyes that they aren't going to give up, they are going to rebuild.&quot; So far &quot;Love Is Free&quot; has gained much airplay in the States and has already begun to enter the Billboard charts: the U.S. Hot 100 (#77), the Canadian Hot 100 (#53) and the Japanese Hot 100 (#10).\n\nPerhaps coincidentally, while the New Orleans-inspired single was distributed and its allusions were noted by Crow during appearances on American television, the album itself was released on the day of Mardi Gras.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;God Bless This Mess&quot;  \t2:09\n2.\t&quot;Shine Over Babylon&quot; (Lyrics: Crow, Bill Bottrell; Music: Crow, Bottrell, Brian MacLeod, Eric Schermerhorn)\t4:03\n3.\t&quot;Love Is Free&quot; (Lyrics and Music: Crow, Bottrell)\n3:23\n4.\t&quot;Peace Be Upon Us&quot; (feat.

Crow's excitement is noticed throughout the record.[22]\n\nBillboard magazine says &quot;100 miles is a path Crow was certainly wise to tread&quot;, praising her celebratory mind frame and the joyous mood of lead single &quot;Summer Day&quot;, as well as &quot;Peaceful Feeling&quot; and first track &quot;Our Love is Fading&quot;.
