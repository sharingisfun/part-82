They are colleagues, best friends and roommates, \nalthough in all capacities their relationship is always tested primarily by Sheldon's \nregimented and non-conventional ways. They are also friends with their Cal Tech \ncolleagues, mechanical engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali. \nThe foursome spend their time working on their individual work projects, playing video \ngames, watching science fiction movies or reading comic books. As they are self-professed \nnerds, all have little or no luck with &quot;popular&quot; women. When Penny, a pretty woman and an \naspiring actress originally from Omaha, moves into the apartment next to Leonard and \nSheldon's, Leonard has another aspiration in life, namely to get Penny to be his girlfriend.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c5ad3d409b2256ab1305f6b2c3f85667292102d","amp;dn":"The+Big+Bang+Theory+S04E01+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c5ad3d409b2256ab1305f6b2c3f85667292102d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,90,211,212,9,178,37,106,177,48,95,107,44,63,133,102,114,146,16,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
