The album, which features music composed and conducted by\nAcademy Award-winner James Horner (Titanic, A Beautiful Mind, An American Tail),\nwill be released physically on December 15th. Avatar arrives in theatres\neverywhere on December 18th.\n\nWritten and directed by Academy Award-winner James Cameron (Titanic, Aliens, The\nTerminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, True Lies, The Abyss), Avatar takes us\nto a spectacular new world beyond our imagination, where a reluctant hero\nembarks on a journey of redemption and discovery as he leads a heroic battle to\nsave a civilization. Cameron first conceived the film 14 years ago, when the\nmeans to realize his vision did not yet exist. Now, after four years of actual\nproduction work, Avatar delivers a fully immersive cinematic experience of a new\nkind, where the revolutionary technology invented to make the film disappears\ninto the emotion of the characters and the sweep of the story.\n\nAvatar stars Sam Worthington (Terminator Salvation), ZoÃƒÆ’","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32db05dcf0f38dab171999627494d09310bdb2f3","amp;dn":"VA-Avatar+%28Music+From+The+Motion+Picture%29-OST-2009-DOH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32db05dcf0f38dab171999627494d09310bdb2f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,219,5,220,240,243,141,171,23,25,153,98,116,148,208,147,16,189,178,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
