It was also Finland's first placement in the top five. It was voted as the most popular Finnish Eurovision entry in the forty years the country has participated. It held the record for most points until it was beaten by &quot;Fairytale&quot; by Alexander Rybak of Norway with 387 points three years later. &quot;Hard Rock Hallelujah&quot; was also released as a single in 2006, reaching the #1 spot in Finland and also peaking in the UK Top 40 at #25.\n\nThe video starts with a shy female hard rock fan walking through the corridors of a school, singing softly along to the song playing on her headset. She reaches an entrance to the gym, where she stands watching the cheerleaders practice. Suddenly, the lights flicker and go out, and a wind starts to blow. As the chorus starts to play, the doors to the gym are blown off of their hinges by Mr. Lordi, who enters and crushes the now-screaming cheerleaders with a wave of his hands killing them. There is a fiery flash, and the entire band appears in the centre of the gym, playing the song.\n\nThe fan is terrified, but approaches Mr. Lordi as he points to her, singing &quot;... you will see the jokers soon'll be the new kings&quot;. He raises the dead cheerleaders as zombies, and they stand around the fan pumping their fists in the air along with the music. The end of the video shows the fan, now confident and unafraid, leading the zombies through the school halls as students run away. She stops and punches the air with her fist as the zombies rush around her towards a group of students who are trapped by the closed main doors.\n\nThe video was directed by Pete Riski. The fan is played by Leina Ogihara.\n\nLordi is a Finnish hard rock band, which was formed in 1996 by the band's lead singer, songwriter and costume-designer, Mr. Lordi. The band is known for wearing monster masks and using pyrotechnics during concerts.\n\nLordi made history in 2006 by winning the Eurovision Song Contest with a record 292 points, becoming the first Finnish band to win the contest. Lordi was featured on the 2006 MTV Europe Music Awards in Copenhagen when the band's frontman, Mr. Lordi, presented the award for rock. They were also the closing act, playing their single &quot;Hard Rock Hallelujah&quot;. They also performed on Britain's Making Your Mind Up for the Eurovision Song Contest. Lordi performed on the main stage at Ozzfest 2007 and later that year toured with Type O Negative and Twin Method until Halloween night.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed654d498f2c8c726dc99193ca4f788a2363bf60","amp;dn":"Lordi+-+Hard+Rock+Hallelujah+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed654d498f2c8c726dc99193ca4f788a2363bf60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,101,77,73,143,44,140,114,109,201,145,147,202,79,120,138,35,99,191,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
