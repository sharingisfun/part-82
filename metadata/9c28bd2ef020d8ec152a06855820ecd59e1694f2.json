IF 20-40 was back you would be getting MORE files &amp; FASTER.\n\nPLEASE consider donating to getting him a new PC. Consider it an investment in getting the best torrents available. It will save you money in long term, as soon 20-40 files will not be available at ALL. He is only able to encode on an old PC that he resurrected and that crashes every 10 mintues. It will soon die and then we won't even be able to e-mail him.\n\nI am asking you to consider how much money he saves you by providing HIGH-QAULITY &amp; SMALL FILE SIZE torrents.\nJust spend a few minutes and consider if you have to resort to getting every file as some crappy .avi at a minimum of 350MB???\n\nAny all contributions are welcome and NEEDED, even a few bucks could make the difference.\n\nA fan, \nJon\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c28bd2ef020d8ec152a06855820ecd59e1694f2","amp;dn":"Craig.Ferguson.2010.07.12.Julie.Chen.H264%5Blepton%5D.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c28bd2ef020d8ec152a06855820ecd59e1694f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,40,189,46,240,32,216,236,21,42,6,133,88,32,236,213,158,22,148,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
