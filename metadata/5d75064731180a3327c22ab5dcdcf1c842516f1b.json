We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember where we heard of them or in what context. The name doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ring a bell at all and if you look at their MySpace, they have barely any plays on their songs, which is strange given how awesome their music is. We canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even find much written on them. Not even a Pitchfork  review yet?? WTF??&quot;\n-This Hearts On Fire\n\nPost-Punk, Lo-Fi, Indie Rock at it's finest.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d75064731180a3327c22ab5dcdcf1c842516f1b","amp;dn":"Accordion+Crimes+-+%282009%29+A+Higher+Quality+Version+of+This+%5BEP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d75064731180a3327c22ab5dcdcf1c842516f1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,117,6,71,49,24,10,51,39,194,42,181,220,220,241,200,66,81,111,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
