The German economist and politician helped make Germany a renewable energy powerhouse and inspired many across the world to expand the use of solar power. Scheer had been member of the German parliament for three decades and was the president of EUROSOLAR, the European Association for Renewable Energy. In 1999, he won the Right Livelihood Award for his &quot;indefatigable work for the promotion of solar energy worldwide.&quot; When he received the award, he described solar energy as the energy of the people. We met up with Herman Scheer last month in Bonn, Germany, for what turned out to be one of his final interviews.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84dd6c3bd9d5cc7ac22f071b46f3b4c542caecf9","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+15+oct+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84dd6c3bd9d5cc7ac22f071b46f3b4c542caecf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,221,108,59,217,213,204,122,194,47,7,27,70,243,180,197,66,202,236,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
