Generation Zero explores the cultural roots of the global financial meltdown - beginning with the narcissism of the 1960's, spreading like a virus through the self-indulgent 90's, and exploding across the world in the present economic cataclysm.\n\nGeneration Zero goes beneath the shallow media headlines and talking head sound bites to get to the source of today's economic nightmare. With a cutting edge style and haunting imagery, this must see documentary will change everything you thought you knew about Wall Street and Washington.\n\nFeaturing experts, authors, and pundits from across the political spectrum, Generation Zero exposes the little told story of how the mindset of the baby boomers sowed the seeds of economic disaster that will be reaped by coming generations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46ff674cdc7c7763b602db3ae7203248cf258d0b","amp;dn":"Generation+Zero+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46ff674cdc7c7763b602db3ae7203248cf258d0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,255,103,76,220,124,119,99,182,2,219,58,231,32,50,72,207,37,141,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
