Now we know segmenting isn't banned for TV XviD      \n         (yet...) but if you're going to do it then at least do a      \n         halfway fucking decent job of it. See included bitrate        \n         graph to see the terrible guessing they did, and the          \n         included quant graph to see what happened when they ran       \n         out of bits at the end. Note the fairly even average quant    \n         for a real 2 pass, and the huge spike in quants (and drop     \n          in quality) when P0W4failure ran out of bits at the end.      \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                           CTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD                       \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
