The protocol is based on SRTP, a system that \nuses the 256-bit AES cipher and adds to that a 3,000-bit key exchange that produces the codes callers can read off to \none another. It has been submitted to IETF for approval as an internet standard, and by most accounts is strong enough \nto defy even the most sophisticated code-breaking technologies, from a hacker's packet sniffer to the acres of \ncomputers beneath Ft. Meade. \n\nThat makes Zfone the &quot;most secure telephone system anyone has ever used,&quot; according to PGP Corporation's CTO Jon \nCallas, who worked with Zimmermann on the protocol.\n\n\nQ: What is Zfone? \n\nA: ZfoneÃƒÂ¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:628f5b0a204a9114b8762d421b35958754747546","amp;dn":"DEFCON.15+T203+-+The+Zfone+Project+%28Cryptophone%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"628f5b0a204a9114b8762d421b35958754747546","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,143,91,10,32,74,145,20,184,118,45,66,27,53,149,135,84,116,117,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
