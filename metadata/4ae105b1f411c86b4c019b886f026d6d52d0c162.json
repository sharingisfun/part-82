The video is a clip of the scars on my body that I\\'ve damaged and altered by artificial and hardware methods.\n\nThe corruption of the video is my digital representation of how IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been changed from physical perfection to an imperfection.  The audio is pulled from the video to produce a composition that is imprinted over a audio wave with my name.  The visuals have then been extended from 15 seconds to over an hour to visualize the permanence of my disability.\n\nThe use of torrent gives a little bit of myself to everyone allowing me to finally accept my disability and share it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ae105b1f411c86b4c019b886f026d6d52d0c162","amp;dn":"d.self.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ae105b1f411c86b4c019b886f026d6d52d0c162","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,225,5,177,244,17,200,107,76,1,155,136,111,2,109,109,82,208,193,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
