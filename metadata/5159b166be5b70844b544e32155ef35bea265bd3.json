They witnessed THE greatest television score start, develop and\nultimately bring us to its emotionally walloping end. When that first episode\nof the pilot aired it had such a visceral impact because of the music. The\ndanger, the isolation, the hope and the mystery of the entire show flooded into\nus through Giacchinos score. It can be intense, it can be tragic, it can be\nheartwarming but most of all its thematically grounded\n\nSeason 5 was an amazing emotional accomplishment, and before seeing the final\nseason I was dubbing it his greatest work on the series thus far. Although now\nI can say season 6 his is true master brushstroke. In this season the score is\nheavily influenced with Benjamin Linus theme. It pretty much takes its stake\nas the main theme of the season since so much revolves around that character\nTowards the end of the album we get introduced to Jacob's music and some new\nthematic material while familiar themes pop in and out through the journey\n\nThe only problem I have with these LOST score releases is how theyre mixed and\nrecorded. What we have here on these discs from Season 2 beyond are live\nrecording sessions (season 1 clearly was studio mixed for the final dub). Now\nagain, I dont know what the decision is behind this but it leads to some\ndistracting air in the tracks. By air I mean all the sounds of the\nmusicians. You hear rustling, breathing and moving around. For instance at 1:17\nin the track For Love Of The Dame you get a full blown sniffle from someone\nThe fact that got recorded in the final mix is kind of mind blowing. Now, I\nknow Im nitpicking here and these are really minor distractions, but they are\ndistractions nonetheless. If I were sitting and watching a movie and someone\nwas sniffling and rustling behind me I would turn around and tell them to pipe\ndown. Same goes for my score listening experience, except I cant tell the\nmusicians to stop knocking about\n\nIn the long run the fact that I am listening to another chapter in the greatest\ntelevision score ever composed makes me forget about the rush mixing job. Its\na must buy and will give your tear ducts a good draining\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5159b166be5b70844b544e32155ef35bea265bd3","amp;dn":"Michael_Giacchino-Lost_Season_5-%28OST%29-2010-CFD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5159b166be5b70844b544e32155ef35bea265bd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,89,177,102,190,91,112,132,75,84,78,50,21,94,243,91,234,38,91,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
