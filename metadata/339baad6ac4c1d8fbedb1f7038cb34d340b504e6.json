These &quot;rar&quot; &quot;files&quot; are the safest way to download from public trackers especially if there is a &quot;sfv&quot; and an &quot;nfo&quot; file included as that indicates the release is good, while i understand that &quot;rar&quot; files double the hard drive space needed to unpack and of course seed is not an option for some of you guys, but safety is the way to go in my opinion, anyways all the words i have quoted &quot;quote&quot; please google them , then you will be better informed.\n\n\nIf You need more help understanding the scene Google it :) \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   nfo\n\nUFC.121.Lesnar.vs.Velasquez.Weigh.Ins.HDTV.x264-RUDOS\n\n\n\n[EVENT]: UFC.121.Lesnar.vs.Velasquez.Weigh.Ins.HDTV.x264-RUDOS\n[RELEASED]: 10.22.2010\n[AIRED]: 10.22.2010\n[SIZE]: 350 MB\n[CHANNEL]: Directv 101\n[CONTAINER]: mp4\n[RESOLUTION]: 704 x 400 (16:9) @ 29.970 FPS\n[VIDEO]: x264 @ 1673 kbps\n[AUDIO]: AAC @ 192 kbps\n[LENGTH]: 26 Mins \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:339baad6ac4c1d8fbedb1f7038cb34d340b504e6","amp;dn":"UFC.121.Lesnar.vs.Velasquez.Weigh.Ins.HDTV.x264-RUDOS++%28BX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"339baad6ac4c1d8fbedb1f7038cb34d340b504e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,155,170,214,172,76,29,143,190,219,31,112,56,203,52,211,64,181,4,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
