After Palmer's death, Stewart began using the Palmer-style arrangement in live concerts.\n\nKelly Clarkson covered the song for her All I Ever Wanted Summer Fair Tour. The lyrics were also altered to the female perspective.\n\nJeff Fortgang, the song's composer, created many songs during his 3 years in the music business after graduating Yale in 1971, but sold only this one (other than several public service radio spots on topics such as alcoholism and VD). He went on to get a PhD in Clinical Psychology, and still works in the mental health field in the Boston area. The major hit by Rod Stewart arrived after Fortgang was well into his psychology career.\n\nCamouflage is a studio album released by Rod Stewart on June 18, 1984. It was StewartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 13th studio album and was released on Warner Bros. Records (WEA 925 095-1). Three singles came from this album. They were ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œInfatuationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSome Guys Have All the LuckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and a cover of the Free  hit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAll Right NowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nThe album received similar reviews to its predecessor, Body Wishes, although Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic  called it &quot;relatively better&quot;, due to a couple of strong singles in &quot;Infatuation&quot; and &quot;Some Guys Have All The Luck&quot;. A review was not given in Rolling Stone magazine, but in the review for the album's successor, Every Beat of My Heart, they called the album &quot;overly slick&quot;. It currently holds the lowest rating on George Starostin's Music Reviews.\n\nCamouflage peaked at #8 on the UK charts and reached a silver sales certification  on June 27, 1984. In the US it peaked at #18 and went gold on August 12, 1984. Although no single from the album reached the UK  Top 10, two made the US Top 10, &quot;Infatuation&quot; (#6) and &quot;Some Guys Have All the Luck&quot; (#10).\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4e5dcb86267eaf6b755719d26a10686c7065592","amp;dn":"Rod+Stewart+-+Some+Guys+Have+All+The+Luck+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4e5dcb86267eaf6b755719d26a10686c7065592","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,229,220,184,98,103,234,246,183,85,113,157,38,161,6,134,199,6,85,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
