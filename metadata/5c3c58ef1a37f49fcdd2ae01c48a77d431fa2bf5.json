Access to the remote and impoverished town of Santa MarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a Tlahuitoltepec has been restricted, with roads and bridges washed out by the rain or blocked by the landslide. Initial estimates suggested hundreds of people could be dead and up to a 1,000 people trapped in their homes, but Mexican authorities now say only eleven people have been confirmed missing. We go to Oaxaca to speak with filmmaker David Riker.\n\n\n- &quot;The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration&quot;: Isabel Wilkerson Tracks Exodus of Blacks from US South\n\nWe turn now to a pivotal but largely overlooked event in US history, the mass migration of millions of African Americans from the South during the period of the Great Migration, which began in the 1910s and continued to the 1970s. Award-winning journalist and professor Isabel Wilkerson has spent the last decade researching why millions of African Americans decided to leave the towns and farms of the South on such a large scale for her new book, The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c3c58ef1a37f49fcdd2ae01c48a77d431fa2bf5","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+29+sep+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c3c58ef1a37f49fcdd2ae01c48a77d431fa2bf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,60,88,239,26,55,244,159,205,210,174,1,196,138,119,212,49,250,43,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
