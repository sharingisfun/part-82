All seven episodes from the first season of Conspiracy Theory. Easily burnable so that we can get the word out.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. HAARP-Jesse Ventura leads a team of investigators to Alaska to determine if a project called the High Frequency Auroral Research Program is just a communications project or a weapon to change the weather, shoot down satellites or achieve universal mind control.\n\n\n\n\n2. 911-Jesse Ventura and his team investigate the possibility that the attacks of September 11, 2001, were actually plotted not by foreign terrorists but by Americans with a sinister agenda of their own.\n\n\n\n\n3. Global Warming-Jesse Ventura and his team of investigators interview an MIT scientist, businessmen, and others and follow the man thought to be the mastermind behind the global warming phenomenon to China to uncover the truth. Jesse also uncovers what might be a plot to force the world to conform to businesses that are coercing us to consume their green products, which are ran by powerful businessmen bent on controlling the world through a centralized government.\n\n\n\n\n4. Big Brother-In this episode, we learn that &quot;Big Brother&quot; includes more than Government agents. Jesse Ventura and his team investigate a nationwide group known as &quot;InfraGard&quot; - a partnership between the FBI and private citizens recruited to spy on their friends, neighbors, and coworkers. Through a surprisingly advancing network of cameras and detection equipment available since 9/11, the Government has widened its net of surveillance in our everyday lives. Jesse interviews top officials of InfraGard to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n5. Secret Societies(Bilderberg Group)-Jesse Ventura and the team investigate the Bildergberg Group - a group that meets annually in secret heavily-guarded meetings in Europe, America, and Canada. Jesse learns that the Bilderberg Group comprises some of the most powerful people in the world, including heads of states and business leaders who want to control the world through a centralized government. Jesse also uncovers the Bilderberg's plan to reduce the world's population by up to 90% through the use of vaccines and food distribution control, in order to make control of the world easier.\n\n\n\n\n6. Manchurian Candidate-In this episode, Jesse Ventura and his team learn about the &quot;Manchurian Candidate&quot; program - the Government's use of ordinary citizens as super soldiers to carry-out Government black ops, like assassinations. Governor Ventura learns how candidates are chosen, subjected to intense psychological stress and trauma, hypnotized, given microchip implants, and given keywords that when activated instruct them to kill on command without any recollection of the events. Jesse and the team interview an author and experts on the subject, and Jesse meets a man who claims to be a member of the Manchurian Candidate program.\n\n\n\n\n7. Apocalypse 2012-Did the Mayan calendar correctly predict the end of the world in 2012? In this episode Jesse Ventura and his team of investigators speak with scientists and experts that are convinced that solar flare-ups will cause massive electrical grid failures that will result in nationwide failure of all basic city services, bringing about utter chaos and panic in America. Jesse also investigates how America's elite are preparing for the 2012 doomsday by building secret underground facilities, including a massive underground facility located right under the Denver International Airport.\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe websites of Joe Blow: \n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.concen.cc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.concen.cc&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.umunu.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.umunu.com&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.umu.mu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.umu.mu&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSend tips to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;bed4d1dbdcd2d1c9fecbd3cbd0cb90ddd1d3&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; or call skype:joeblowman\t\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a4995c49b8c36e00ae9069fee8e6dbf80c80382","amp;dn":"%5Bconcen.cc%5D+Conspiracy+Theory+with+Jesse+Ventura+Season+1+comple","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a4995c49b8c36e00ae9069fee8e6dbf80c80382","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,73,149,196,155,140,54,224,10,233,6,159,238,142,109,191,128,200,3,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
