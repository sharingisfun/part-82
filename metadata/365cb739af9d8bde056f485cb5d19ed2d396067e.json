The purpose - to show you what (not) to do if you end up stranded in the wilderness.\n \nMan VS idiocy is a Mockumentary combining the styles of both Man VS Wild and Survivorman. It was scouted and shot over a 7 day period by Collin Williams who spent all nights and days alone out in the forest miles from civilization. Tools on hand for survival were minimal with just a multi-tool, magnesium fire starter, two 32 oz bottles, and 1 packet of top ramen available for the entire 7 days.\n\n \n\nMan VS Idiocy was also solely produced and funded by Collin. If you enjoyed MVI please donate (see donate page) and help fund MVI 2. 100% of all donation go directly to funding future MVI's\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:365cb739af9d8bde056f485cb5d19ed2d396067e","amp;dn":"Man+VS+Idiocy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"365cb739af9d8bde056f485cb5d19ed2d396067e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,92,183,57,175,157,139,222,5,111,72,92,181,209,158,210,211,150,6,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
