He and his \nbest friend Spike Nolan (John Candy), the catcher for the \nBulls, are arrested after a bar fight, but cannot afford bail. \nA stranger (posing as a photographer) offers bail, and asks \nthem to come to New York with him. At a Manhattan law office, \nBrewster is told that his recently deceased great-uncle Rupert \nHorn (Hume Cronyn) - who he's never met - has left him his \nentire fortune, but with several conditions.\n\nBrewster is challenged to either take $1 million upfront, \nor spend $30 million within 30 days to inherit $300 million. \nIf he chooses the former, the law firm becomes the executor \nof the estate and divides the money among charities \n(after taking a sizable fee). In the latter case, after 30 days, \nhe may not own any assets that are not already his, and he \nmust get value for the services of anyone he hires. He may \ndonate only 5% to charity and lose 5% by gambling. Neither \nmay he buy expensive goods and destroy or give them away. \nAnd he's not allowed to tell anyone, even Spike. Monty decides \nto take the $30 million challenge. A paralegal from the law firm \nmust accompany him to keep tabs on all spending.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba99942b9aca56546dd63ca9c8f676f6acc4443","amp;dn":"Brewsters+Millions+-+Classic+1980s++Film","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba99942b9aca56546dd63ca9c8f676f6acc4443","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,169,153,66,185,172,165,101,70,221,99,202,156,143,103,111,106,204,68,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
