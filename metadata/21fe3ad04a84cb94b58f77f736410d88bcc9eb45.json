Along with Henning von Tresckow and Hans Oster, he was one of the central figures of the German Resistance movement within the Wehrmacht. For his involvement in the movement he was shot shortly after the failed attempt known as Operation Valkyrie.\n \nThis documentary reconstructs that day and using actors, 3d animation and a lot of film making tricks and presents it as it might have been caught on tape if there were cameras on site.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21fe3ad04a84cb94b58f77f736410d88bcc9eb45","amp;dn":"The+Real+Valkyrie%3A+Secret+plot+to+kill+Hitler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21fe3ad04a84cb94b58f77f736410d88bcc9eb45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,254,58,208,74,132,203,148,181,143,119,247,54,65,13,136,188,201,235,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
