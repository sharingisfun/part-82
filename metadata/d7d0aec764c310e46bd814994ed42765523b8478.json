As building commenced, a huge old Banyan tree blocked the construction's path. A work crew call in a mechanical digger to remove the tree. As the roots are torn from the ground, 1000s of cobra bones explode from the earth, tearing them to pieces. After the passing of the grim massacre, witnesses who survived tell strange stories about an evil Cobra spirit. Years later when a new apartment block was built on the grounds, Nin, the building's owner, has to face the horrifying matter when hundreds of cobras hellbent on killing every living person in the apartment appear. People believe that again it is the vengeance of the Spirit. How will they survive being hunted by vengeance without mercy?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7d0aec764c310e46bd814994ed42765523b8478","amp;dn":"The.Intruder.2010.DVDRip.XViD.AC3-LuCiFeR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7d0aec764c310e46bd814994ed42765523b8478","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,208,174,199,100,195,16,228,107,216,20,153,78,212,39,101,82,59,132,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
