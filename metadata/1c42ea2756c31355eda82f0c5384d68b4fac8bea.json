And &quot;Hank and Fred&quot; walks a circuitous path to link the great Hank Williams with Mr. Rogers. But as usual, Wainwright best burrows into the brain with songs of 3 a.m., head-holding pain, e.g., &quot;Had to Be Her,&quot; in which he declares that &quot;love is a lesion.&quot; Things get darker from there, believe it or not, and shrinks have labels for what most of these songs evoke. Wainwright, deftly and notably backed here by Bill Frisell on electric guitar and Greg Leisz on lap and pedal steel guitar, never bores, and he never disappoints. But buyer beware: The Prozac nation had best keep its distance. -ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Alanna Nash \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c42ea2756c31355eda82f0c5384d68b4fac8bea","amp;dn":"Loudon+Wainwright+III...Here+Come+the+Choppers%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c42ea2756c31355eda82f0c5384d68b4fac8bea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,66,234,39,86,195,19,85,237,168,47,12,83,132,214,139,79,172,139,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
