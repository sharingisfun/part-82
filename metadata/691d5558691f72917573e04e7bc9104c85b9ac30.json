Quality is pretty decent considering it's a transfer. Some IMDB info: Hosted by Nick and his demented zombie puppet Happy, they treat a theater full of zombies to 83 minutes of cool trailers from horror and gore flicks from 70's (mostly). Between trailers Nick &amp; Happy tell some pretty lame jokes. Two things would've made this a little better. 1.Less of Nick and his annoying puppet 2.More obscure films Overall, its one of the best trailer tapes ive seen (and i've seen a few). 8/10 Here's a a few of the trailers on the tape - I Drink your Blood Deranged Three on a Meathook Love me Deadly Cannibal Girls Deep Red Toxic Zombies Black Christmas Blood and Lace Bay of Blood Ilsa Last House on the Left TCM Blood spattered Bride I Dismember Mama Torso Beyond the Door","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:691d5558691f72917573e04e7bc9104c85b9ac30","amp;dn":"Mad+Ron%5C%27s+Prevues+From+Hell+%28Exploitation+Trailer+Tape+vhs+to+d","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"691d5558691f72917573e04e7bc9104c85b9ac30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,29,85,88,105,31,114,145,117,115,224,78,123,201,16,76,133,185,172,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
