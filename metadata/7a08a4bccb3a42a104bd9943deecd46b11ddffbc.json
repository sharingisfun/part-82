With over ten hours of lecture, Kevin creates a well-structured foundation for Maya's scripting language. Through an in-depth look at what goes on under Maya's hood, he leads you to a firm understanding of commands, syntax and procedures. Based on real-life production examples of MEL scripts, the second disc of this set delves right into advanced scripting methods. By carefully dissecting every line of code in an existing script, you will learn about each command, Kevin's scripting workflows, tricks and common pitfalls.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a08a4bccb3a42a104bd9943deecd46b11ddffbc","amp;dn":"Gnomon+-+MEL+101+Fundamentals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a08a4bccb3a42a104bd9943deecd46b11ddffbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,8,164,188,203,58,66,161,4,189,153,67,222,236,212,107,17,221,255,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
