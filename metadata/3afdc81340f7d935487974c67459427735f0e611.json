Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n \n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor more of my torrents: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/big_dad_e/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/big_dad_e/&lt;/a&gt;  (Secured)\n\nAll torrents scanned with:\nNorton Anti-virus\nMalwarebytes' Anti-malware\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pirate-party.us/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pirate-party.us/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nALWAYS SEED!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3afdc81340f7d935487974c67459427735f0e611","amp;dn":"Oliver+Twist%281948%29%5BDVDRip%5D%5Bbig_dad_e%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3afdc81340f7d935487974c67459427735f0e611","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,253,200,19,64,247,217,53,72,121,116,198,116,89,66,119,53,240,230,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
