Operating systems and applications running in virtualized environments often leave few traces, yielding little evidence with which to conduct an investigation.\n\nVirtualization and Forensics offers an in-depth view into the world of virtualized environments and the implications they have on forensic investigations. Part I explains the process of virtualization and the different types of virtualized environments. Part II details how virtualization interacts with the basic forensic process, describing the methods used to find virtualization artifacts in dead and live environments as well as identifying the virtual activities that affect the examination process. Part III address advanced virtualization issues, such as the challenges of virtualized environments, cloud computing, and the future of virtualization. After reading this book, you'll be equipped to conduct investigations in these environments with confidence.\n\n\n\n* Gives you the end-to-end knowledge needed to identify server, desktop, and portable virtual environments, including: VMware, Parallels, Microsoft, and Sun\n\n* Covers technological advances in virtualization tools, methods, and issues in digital forensic investigations\n\n* Explores trends and emerging technologies\nsurrounding virtualization technology\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nDiane Barrett\nCCNA, CISSP, ISSMP, IAM/IEM Certified Steganographer, CCE Certificate of completion.\n\nGreg Kipper\nAuthor of &quot;Investigator's Guide to Steganography&quot; and &quot;Wireless Crime and Forensic Investigation&quot;.\nContents\n\n*\n\nPART 1 VIRTUALIZATION\nChapter 1 How Virtualization Happens\nChapter 2 Server Virtualization\nChapter 3 Desktop Virtualization\n*\n\nChapter 4 Portable Virtualization, Emulators, and Appliances\n\nPART 2 FORENSICS\nChapter 5 Investigating Dead Virtual Environments\nChapter 6 Investigating Live Virtual Environments\nChapter 7 Finding and Imaging Virtual Environments\n\nPART 3 ADVANCED VIRTUALIZATION\nChapter 8 Virtual Environments and Compliance\nChapter 9 Virtualization Challenges\nChapter 10 Cloud Computing and the Forensic Challenges\nChapter 11 Visions of the Future: Virtualization and Cloud Computing\nAppendix: Performing Physical-to-Virtual and Virtual-to-Virtual Migrations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e07eabe9de7d1cb71c198165ca923c4315b44a2b","amp;dn":"SYNGRESS+-+Virtualization+and+Forensics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e07eabe9de7d1cb71c198165ca923c4315b44a2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,126,171,233,222,125,28,183,28,25,129,101,202,146,60,67,21,180,74,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
