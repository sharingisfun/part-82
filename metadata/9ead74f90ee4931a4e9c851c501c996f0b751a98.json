There he\nlearns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge's intentions of\ndriving off the native humanoid &quot;Na'vi&quot; in order to mine for the precious\nmaterial scattered throughout their rich woodland. In exchange for the spinal\nsurgery that will fix his legs, Jake gathers intel for the cooperating military\nunit spearheaded by gung-ho Colonel Quaritch, while simultaneously attempting to\ninfiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an &quot;avatar&quot; identity. While Jake\nbegins to bond with the native tribe and quickly falls in love with the\nbeautiful alien Neytiri, the restless Colonel moves forward with his ruthless\nextermination tactics, forcing the soldier to take a stand - and fight back in\nan epic battle for the fate of Pandora.  \n\n\tThis image has been resized.

This version is another lowbitrate experiment.\neBDRIP - Enhanced Bluray Disk Rip means the release where encoder intentionally\nenhance the quality of the source to have quality better than Bluray itself.\n\nRegards to all encoders especially Big thanx to Atom, FLAWL3SS and FraMeSToR crew.\nAlso big thank you to Filix\n\n1. UNFINISHED movies HAVE synchro problemms. This is the nature of highly\ncommpressed content. Also there seems to be the problemm with Haali Media\nSplitter. If you are using Media Player Classic please make sure you have\nenabled INTERNAL FILTER for MP4.\n2. Please COMMENT my work ONLY if you actually seen it. If you HAVE LIKED this\nrelease tell others about it. If you dont tell it too but dont forget to tell\nwhy, so I could learn from your opinion providing you something better in the\nfuture .\n3. I can confirm the xbox360 will play it through WINDOWS media center extender.\nRead this forum http://www.avforums.com/forums/streamers-network-media-players/1107552-what-xbox-360-like-media-extender.html\n4. My releases are different than anybody else, so they SHOULD NOT be compared to\nany existing scene rules. I belive if there are different rules for Telecine\nand for DVDRip there can be also different rule for FASM QEBS releases. If the\nscene will overregulate itself, prohibiting new ideas to come it will soon\nbecome like our goverments.\n5. If you like the movie, gratitude the creators by going to cinema, buying\nBluray/DVD or any other possible way.\n6. The movies can be directly streamable throught WWW, by Adobe Flash Player\nversion 9 or higher.\n7. The name FASM was derived from assembler efficiency. If you write something\ndirectly in assembler it is usually much faster and takes much less size,\nthan the same thing written in C, Java etc... It also means FAchman SoofMan\n- founders of FASM\n8. FASM Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer is the h264 commpression method\noptimised directly for lowbitrate HD contents. It is constantly being improved\n, each revision bringing quality to a new level. Its efficiency over standard\nx264 encoding is explained by the same reason XVID encodes are better than\nDIVX3.\n9. FASM recommends IMGBURN for burning those files into DVD.\n10.Any subtitles made for different releases, but taken from the same source\n(Bluray Rip) should also work with this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ead74f90ee4931a4e9c851c501c996f0b751a98","amp;dn":"AVATAR+2009+BDRip+QEBS+720p+ENG-FASM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ead74f90ee4931a4e9c851c501c996f0b751a98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,173,116,249,14,228,147,26,78,156,133,28,80,28,153,111,11,117,26,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
