Once you get past\nthese few distracting cues - or just edit them out of your playlist - it becomes\na solid action score with heartfelt moments thereafter.\nThis is definitely an above average offering for a summer kid's film leaving me\nhoping for a sequel or maybe just more opportunities for John Ottman to truly\nspread his compositional wings and soar with projects of this variety in the\nnear future!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a77b138734498ccf365b52dde688184bb0c86e72","amp;dn":"John+Ottman+-+Astro+Boy+%28OST%29+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a77b138734498ccf365b52dde688184bb0c86e72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,123,19,135,52,73,140,207,54,91,82,221,230,136,24,75,176,200,110,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
