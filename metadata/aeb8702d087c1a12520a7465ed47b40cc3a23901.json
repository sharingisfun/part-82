It is Neil's first solo release in 7 years since the live album Live at the Whisky: One Night Only in 2003 and the first solo studio album in 15 years since 1995's Carved in Stone.\n\nThe album is largely made up of covers of 1970s rock songs, with only a couple of original tracks thrown in: the title track &quot;Tattoos &amp; Tequila&quot; (written by Marti Frederiksen) which was released as the first single, and &quot;Another Bad Day&quot; (written by Nikki Sixx, James Michael and Tracii Guns). Neil has stated: &quot;This album has nothing to do with Motley Crue, Tattoos and Tequila is basically my life&quot;.\n\nThe album was recorded with Slaughter members Jeff Blando (guitar) and Dana Strum (bass), and drummer Zoltan Chaney.\n\nTrack listing\n\n1.\t&quot;Tattoos &amp; Tequila&quot;  \tMarti Frederiksen\t \n2.\t&quot;He's a Whore&quot;  \tRick Nielsen\t \n3.\t&quot;AC DC&quot;  \tMike Chapman, Nicky Chinn \n4.\t&quot;Nobody's Fault&quot;  \tSteven Tyler, Brad Whitford\t \n5.\t&quot;Another Bad Day&quot;  \tNikki Sixx, James Michael, Tracii Guns, Kevin Kadish\t \n6.\t&quot;No Feelings&quot;  \tSteve Jones, Glen Matlock, Paul Cook, Johnny Rotten\t \n7.\t&quot;Long Cool Woman&quot;  \tAllan Clarke, Roger Cook, Roger Greenaway\t \n8.\t&quot;Another Piece of Meat&quot;  \tRudolf Schenker, Herman Rarebell\t \n9.\t&quot;Who'll Stop the Rain&quot;  \tJohn Fogerty\tCreedence Clearwater\t \n10.\t&quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;  \tDoc Pomus, Mort Shuman\t \n11.\t&quot;The Bitch Is Back&quot;  \tElton John, Bernie Taupin\n12.\t&quot;Beer Drinkers &amp; Hell Raisers&quot; (Bonus track)\tBilly Gibbons, Dusty Hill, Frank Beard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeb8702d087c1a12520a7465ed47b40cc3a23901","amp;dn":"Vince+Neil+-+Tattoos+%26+Tequila+%282010%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeb8702d087c1a12520a7465ed47b40cc3a23901","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,184,112,45,8,124,26,18,82,10,116,101,237,71,180,12,195,162,57,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
