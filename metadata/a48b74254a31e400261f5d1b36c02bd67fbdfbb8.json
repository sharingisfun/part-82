According to the officers heading the project, too many times the talents and expensive training of the best pilots and soldiers go to waste during times of peace. So they enlist Bauers (Wilson), the most under-achieving average guy they've got, to be the test subject for the initial hibernation experiment. Also participating in the top-secret program is Rita (Rudolph), a prostitute who agreed to take part in exchange for dropping some criminal charges against her, among other things. Of course, the experiment, which was to last only a year, goes under due to the arrest of Officer Collins, who is busted for heading a prostitution ring. Seeing as though he was in charge of the experiment, one of the only ones who knew of its existence, and &quot;due to a lot of top-secret red tape... and the massive scandals and base closure that followed, Joe and Rita were forgotten about.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a48b74254a31e400261f5d1b36c02bd67fbdfbb8","amp;dn":"Idiocracy+%282006%29+PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a48b74254a31e400261f5d1b36c02bd67fbdfbb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,139,116,37,74,49,228,0,38,31,93,27,54,192,43,214,127,189,251,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
