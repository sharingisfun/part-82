Michael (Douglas Henshall) finds escape in the bottle. John (Stephen McCole) looks to a psychotic friend for a gun and bullets ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they share a torturous scene that recalls the rape in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; without the Ludwig Van. And Sheila (Rosemarie Stevenson), tired of waiting by Thomas' side, heads home in her mechanized wheelchair only to encounter a cheerful girl with a smile and a party invite.\n\nSheila's is about the only good fortune to be found on a night in which a gale-force wind tears the roof off the parish church.\n\n&quot;Orphans&quot; is the feature-directing debut of Peter Mullan. If that name sounds at all familiar it's because Mullan made a bit of a splash playing the title character in Ken Loach's 1998 drama &quot;My Name is Joe.&quot; While &quot;Orphans&quot; avoids Loach's rabid political agenda, it does bear some gritty similarities to the British director's work ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the pessimistic, working-class protagonists; the attention to detail afforded its characters; and above all, the accents of its cast of unknowns, accents thick enough to require subtitles. To be fair, the dialects aren't as heavy as in Loach's &quot;Riff-Raff,&quot; for example, but the on-screen translations add an appreciable level of comfort.\n\nThere are moments of humor in this dark, disturbing &quot;comedy,&quot; but they are few and far between. &quot;Orphans&quot; may be brutal in its unfailing depiction of the pain of loss but it's also brutally honest; these are tortured, tormented souls who, for no other reason, just want their Mammy. And that's what makes sitting through the film worthwhile, even if the getting there isn't always easy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cfbe1ffd0c2087bb16698c9b6b5657daf503efe","amp;dn":"Orphans1997DvdRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cfbe1ffd0c2087bb16698c9b6b5657daf503efe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,251,225,255,208,194,8,123,177,102,152,201,182,181,101,125,175,80,62,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
