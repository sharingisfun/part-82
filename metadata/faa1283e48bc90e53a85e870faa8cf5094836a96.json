For more advanced lifters, the suggestions in the book might be\nfun. The contra-lateral theory he presents is nearly laughable though.\n\nDarden trains and tracks the progress of two people using the routine described in &quot;42 days&quot;. I\nwish he tracked a larger group of persons and those who are a little more 'ordinary'. He trains\none person who is already an accomplished amateur bodybuilder and another guy who is 18, of a \nhefty frame, and an athlete. I would like to see Darden train someone who isn't a newbie, but \nwho also isn't already a bodybuilder. I would also like to see this routine work on persons\nof slimmer build and who have a difficult time gaining weight..........................\n\n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD AND PLEASE SEED................\n\n\n\nENJOY...............","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faa1283e48bc90e53a85e870faa8cf5094836a96","amp;dn":"HEALTH+AND+BODYBUILDING-+BIGGER+MUSCLES+IN+42+DAYS+-MANTESHWER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faa1283e48bc90e53a85e870faa8cf5094836a96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,161,40,62,72,188,144,229,58,133,232,112,250,168,207,80,148,131,106,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
