This includes Salix new GTK system tools, as well as any bugfix &amp; security upgrades that have been added to Salix 13.0 stable repository. Salix Live installer &amp; LiloSetup also benefited from a number of improvements, various bugfix &amp; new translations.\nWe hope this release will be useful to anyone still using Salix 13.0 series either by choice or necessity. With it we are closing our 'Live' development cycle for that series &amp; will now fully pool our resources towards SalixLive 13.1 for which BTW an alpha iso should be available for testing sometime in the next few days.\n\nmd5sum : be27d8806fcb0878a21c2dd66436a1bd  salixlive-13.0.1.iso\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.salixos.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.salixos.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33dee3156f0ec69b67f2501d3c087c8339e2bcc1","amp;dn":"salixlive-13.0.1.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33dee3156f0ec69b67f2501d3c087c8339e2bcc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,222,227,21,111,14,198,155,103,242,80,29,60,8,124,131,57,226,188,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
