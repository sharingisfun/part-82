Despite his attempts to leave her, he can't help but try \n       and save her when she is threatened by a drug addict. His act of \n       chivalry ends up costing him his life.\n       \n       Michael is called into work on his day off to explain some figures \n       he's lied about in his plans for Holbycare. Things go from bad to \n       worse when a woman he's slept with asks him to operate on her \n       varicose vein. When he realises that Ric is behind people \n       scrutinising his proposal, he punches him and swiftly loses not \n       only his pitch for Holbycare but also his DoS job.\n       \n       Frieda is in a good mood after Oliver asks her out for a drink to \n       say thank you for bailing him out. She even considers applying for \n       an F1 job when Penny pushes her. However, when Penny realises the \n       reason behind Frieda's mood, she asks Oliver what he is playing at. \n       Oliver doesn't want to lead Frieda on and so cancels the drink, and \n       Frieda throws the application form in the bin.\n       \n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3c7a534e5f597c54494f54125d55&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f81e47c4fe7203933677c83ed368e8ebe3f08032","amp;dn":"Holby.City.S12E55.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f81e47c4fe7203933677c83ed368e8ebe3f08032","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,30,71,196,254,114,3,147,54,119,200,62,211,104,232,235,227,240,128,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
