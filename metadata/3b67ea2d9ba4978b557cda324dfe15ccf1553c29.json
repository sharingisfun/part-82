The artist provides the wonderful ambiance for the ninja themed restaurant.\n\nHaruka is a more traditional Japanese world album; fans of world music will likely be impressed by his impressive style. On the whole, the music is what you'd expect Japanese world music to sound like; traditional instruments, traditional sound. \n\nBeyond Eternal takes the traditional Japanese theme and mixes in some more pop elements; tracks feel more backed up by other instruments and have a different but equally enjoyable energy. \n\nTwo albums, two different styles, one great artist.\n\n\n----Track Listing----\n\n==Beyond Eternal==\n\n1.
