With Carlos Santana as music director and special guest guitarist, 3 musical legends took the stage. Each one delivered a full concert set packed with some of the finest blues guitar playing you'll ever hear. Bobby Parker, Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Brown, and Buddy Guy are all headline acts in their own right so it was a real coup to get them on one line-up. Throw in the guest appearances by Carlos Santana and Chic Meastro Nile Rodgers, and blues heaven is complete!\n\nLPCM audio (2ch, 48kHz, 24-bit) demuxed, from DVD, and converted to FLAC. It's lossless.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec701e335d113c51a51430b015004737def2e8ad","amp;dn":"Carlos+Santana+Presents%3A+Blues+At+Montreux+2004","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec701e335d113c51a51430b015004737def2e8ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,112,30,51,93,17,60,81,165,20,48,176,21,0,71,55,222,242,232,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
