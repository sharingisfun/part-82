The result- a sound somewhere between Gothenburg and Galway! &quot;A Stupid Thing to Do&quot; is their third album, following hot on the heels of two extremely successful previous releases (&quot;West of Eden&quot; (1997) and &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; (2001)), and a European tour which saw the band play to appreciative audiences in Holland, Belgium and (of course) Ireland. \nThis third album has received pretty rave reviews in their homeland, being thumbed as &quot;a world class album&quot; (Arbetarbladet) and &quot;simply quite fantastic!&quot; (SLA). Jenny Schaub's lead vocals are certainly quite remarkable, and the tunes are pretty listener-friendly, which inevitably leads to a description as the Swedish answer to The Corrs. Then again, we shouldn't be drawing comparisons at this stage, would we? Together, the band (Jenny Schaub- lead vocals and accordion, Martin Schaub- piano, keyboards, guitar, mandolin, dobro, additional accordion, Oyvind Eriksen - bass, Ola Karlevo- drums and percussion, David Ekh- electric guitar, ebow, additional acoustic guitar and Tobias Edvardson- fiddle, viola, backing vocals) create their own unique sound which is their major strength. A very listenable album indeed! \nMore information on West of Eden can be found on their website: www.westofeden.com. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp \n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71e835da5f8bcf3dc276b13f154668779db04e4c","amp;dn":"West+of+Eden...A+Stupid+Thing+to+Do%282003%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71e835da5f8bcf3dc276b13f154668779db04e4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,232,53,218,95,139,207,61,194,118,177,63,21,70,104,119,157,176,78,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
