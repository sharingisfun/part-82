Years, pass without a word from him, but his wife never gives up hope of seeing him again. (IMDB)\n\n\nSubtitle info:\n\nThe subtitles for this film are an extremeley edited version of a srt file that was downloaded fromThe original english subtitles were translated from portuguese using a google translation program and were pretty much an unintelligble mess. I cleaned up the gramatical errors and re-translated some phrases &quot;english -&gt; portuguese-&gt; spanish -&gt; english&quot;. Using that and a little common sense, I composed this new srt file, which I hope does not contain too many gross mistakes.\n\nIf anyone else wants to improve this version, please make a torrent of the new improved subtitles file without including the movie. That way only have upload 100KB instead of 1GB to get the improved version.\n\n\nI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:875ee865ed70395967fa547c9595da55edd0f513","amp;dn":"The.Anarchists.Wife%28Spanish+w%2F+English+Subtitles%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"875ee865ed70395967fa547c9595da55edd0f513","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,94,232,101,237,112,57,89,103,250,84,124,149,149,218,85,237,208,245,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
