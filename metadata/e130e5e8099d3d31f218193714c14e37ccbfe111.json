Still, this series is an experience of other cultures, like no other, so episode quality is the least thing you will focus on.\n\n\nHope you enjoy, and please keep on seeding, I can't seed this for too long. Cheers!\n\n\n\n\nHere follows description from wikipedia:\n\n\n\nMeet the Natives: USA is an American reality television series that premiered on the Travel Channel on November 29, 2009.[1] The series follows five tribesmen from the island of Tanna, Vanuatu, as they travel to the United States on an adventure to explore America and the American way of life.
