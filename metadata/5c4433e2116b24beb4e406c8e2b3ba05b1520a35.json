Giuseppe Patane was one of the best Italian opera conductors of his generation, and he treats Verdi's masterpiece with stylistic sensitivity allied to technical expertise. Franco Bonisolli is visually and vocally just right for the role of the impetuous Alfredo and Gino Bechi gives a properly stern portrayal of his insecure, bourgeois father.&quot; --Joe McLellan\n\n\nvideo: X264 704 x 480\naudio: AC3 192 kbps\naudio lang: Italian (of course, it's an opera)\nsubs: English\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Verdi-Traviata-Patane-Moffo-Bonisolli/dp/B000083C6X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Verdi-Traviata-Patane-Moffo-Bonisolli/dp/B000083C6X&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Verdi-Traviata-Patane-Moffo-Bonisolli/dp/6302166888&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Verdi-Traviata-Patane-Moffo-Bonisolli/dp/6302166888&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBeing very old don't expect crystal clear quality.\nI OCRed the DVD subs to srt, but the original idx/sub are also included, if needed.
