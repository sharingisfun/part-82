Some may be missing covers, lack detailed Bookmarking, and none are searchable (not that that's possible for the script books but...).\nThey are optomized pdfs with Acrobat 9.\n\n\nFile list:\nThere are 2 versions of the primary Chinese-Mongolian (Script) Dictionary used in Inner Mongolia. One High res, one low.\n\nEnglish Chinese Mongolian (Script) Dictionary\n\nMongolian (Script) Chinese English Dictionary\n\nMongolian (Script) Chinese Dictionary\n\nA Colloqual Mongolian Course (I and II) (Cyrillic) - it moves fast. University style.\n\nThe End of Nomadism? - An account of an anthropological/social study of the current state of Mongolian people spanning Russia, Mongolia, and 2 Chinese provinces.\n\nHeadless State - a historical Anthropology study of Pastoral Nomadism in Central Asia that debunks some traditional notions of &quot;the Nomad.&quot;\n\nTserenpil's Mongolian Grammar - 4th Edition - an somewhat clunky, awkward grammar of Mongolian. Compare to the (absent from this torrent) grammar of Classical Mongolian. I haven't gotten my hands on it but someone whose knowledge I very much respect considers it superior to this outter Mongolia style grammar of the complex Mongolian Language. In some ways outer Mongolia has lost it's traditional understanding of it's own language, which in a few senses is more &quot;clean&quot; and easy than this grammar.\n\nMongolian (Script) Children's Book\n\nThe Secret History of Mongolia (Mongolian Script) - sorta  crappy modernized rendition - sorry.\n\nMongolian Culture book in Mongolian Script.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:605d556c762ffbff0e9d9d58c066c80dd2103ee9","amp;dn":"Mongolian+Studies+Mini-Pack+%28Language+and+Culture%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"605d556c762ffbff0e9d9d58c066c80dd2103ee9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,93,85,108,118,47,251,255,14,157,157,88,192,102,200,13,210,16,62,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
