ABOUT\n\nredump.org's goal is to have a complete database of disc-based media using only\noriginal media. They provide the necessary tools and info to users so that\ndiscs can be preserved by using high standard/strict dumping methods. They are\nsimilar to groups like GoodTools, No-Intro, TOSEC.\n\nThey currently have more than 14900 (~4700 PSX) disc entries present in their\ndatabase.\n\nThey can be found: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://redump.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://redump.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy dumping missing discs on the redump.org database, you would be helping to\nachieve greater common goal and indirectly helping us to have a more complete,\nverified collection. If you have original black CDs not listed in the PSX\ndatabase or even listed ones, please go that extra mile and learn about their\ndumping methods.\n\nTheir guides on how to dump discs properly can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://redump.org/guide/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://redump.org/guide/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you need more help, you can also visit redump.org's forum: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.redump.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.redump.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nContent of this torrent is not provided by redump.org nor do they encourage\npiracy in any way. Please, no torrent-talk on that site, only database and CD\nmedia related things.\n\n\n1. UNCOMPRESS\n\nThe discs have been packed using PakkISO which works just like torrentzip.\nSimply put, PakkISO is the torrentzip of disc based games. It will create\nexact archives of matching files. It runs the data tracks through ECM, and\nthen compresses with 7z. Audio tracks are compressed using the Monkey Audio\nlossless format (APE). This results in a much higher compression ratio\ncompared to torrentzip.\n\nYou can choose from several programs to use for decompression. They all are\nincluded in this torrent within 'important.rar'.\n\n- PakkISO shell integration *RECOMMENDED* (PakkISO-0.4-setup.exe).[1]\n\nTo unpack a single game, simply right-click the game's folder and select\n'UnpakkISO'.\n\nTo unpack a group of games, simply right-click the folder containing ALL game's\nfolders to be processed, and select 'UnpakkISO (Batch)'. The process will be\nautomated.\n\nTo pack a single game, simply right-click the game's folder and select\n'PakkISO'.\n\nTo pack a group of games, simply right-click the folder containing ALL game's\nfolders to be processed, and select 'PakkISO (Batch)'. The process will be\nautomated.\n\n- PakkISO (PakkISO-0.4-non-install.zip).[1]\n\nTo unpack a game, simply drag and drop the game's folder into unpakkIso.exe.\n\nTo pack a game, simply drag and drop the game's folder into pakkIso.exe.\n\n- redumpExtractor (redumpExtractor_exe.zip or redumpExtractor.zip).[2]\n\nSimple and intuitive GUI program. More information: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thejbnet.com/progs/re/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thejbnet.com/progs/re/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAfter successful decompression you should have one cue sheet file and one or\nseveral binary files.\n\n[1] Archives will be deleted after decompression; raw files after compression,\ni.e. content is transformed from compressed to decompressed state or vice versa.\nSo it is preferable to make a copy of directory you want to work with and use\nthat copy instead of source.\n[2] External programs needed for this application are available in\n'PakkISO-0.4-non-install.zip'.\n\n\n2. PLAY\n\nTo play on real hardware (console), first you need to burn the image(s) to a\ndisc. Using your favorite disc burning software [1] and good quality blank\nmedia, load the '.cue' file and burn. Make sure your console is capable of\nplaying backups.\n\nThe best way to play the games included in this collection on emulators is by\nmounting them on a virtual drive (Daemon Tools/Alcohol). Once you have the disc\nmounted, just open the emulator and 'insert CD drive' (pSX) or 'Run CDROM'\n(ePSXe).\n\n[1] Please do not use Alcohol for recording, it is known to have problems with\ncue sheet parsing and therefore will produce incorrect copies (virtual drive\nfunction works fine though). Recommended programs are: ImgBurn (freeware),\nBlindWrite, CDRWIN.\n\n\n3. AUDIT\n\nIncluded with torrent within 'important.rar' are several '.dat' files, you can\nuse with 'RomCenter', 'clrmamepro' or similar programs:\n\n- 'Sony - PlayStation (20100901 04-03-12) (Japan) (PakkISO).dat'\n\nUse it to verify downloaded files or update from previous collections.\n\n- 'Sony - PlayStation (20100901 04-03-12) (Japan) (RAW - all).dat'\n\nAll Japanese PSX games in database at the moment of creation of this torrent.\nUse it to audit your collection in uncompressed state or look for missing\nimages.\n\n- 'Sony - PlayStation (20100901 04-03-12) (Japan) (RAW - have).dat'\n\nThis is your local database of what you have. Compare it with current one, when\nyou decide to update, to determine what renames, additions, replaces needs to\nbe done.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a187bedeac4a2926eefcae543253d5f4bb592e37","amp;dn":"%5Bredump.org%5D+PSX+%28Japan%29+2010+Fall+%5BN-Si%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a187bedeac4a2926eefcae543253d5f4bb592e37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,135,190,222,172,74,41,38,238,252,174,84,50,83,213,244,187,89,46,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
