A Strategic Analysis of Global\nCurrent and Future Events.\n\nIntroduction:\nThere would be many that would immediately start to protest and argue with the title of\nthis article. They would argue that it was absolutely insane, or at best incompetent on\nmy behalf to even suggest that Russia had plans for world domination. I would argue\nback, (if they would listen), that the factual evidence to support this thesis is undeniable.\nAs an introduction into this article, I would like to include some information from Anatoly\nGolitsyn, who in his 1984 Book, NEW LIES FOR OLD, came out with the startling\nstatement that the leaders of Soviet Communism, mostly from the KGB, had designed\nand implemented a long term, 40+ year plan for total world domination starting in the\nlate 1950's. He knew this because he had worked on the plan as a Major in the KGB\nbefore he defected to the US. He outlined their plan, in detail, which was so fantastic\nthat it was considered too outrageous to consider as even remotely possible by most of\nthe Western Intelligence Community and government leadership.\nThis is from a National Book Review, Sept 7, 1984 (emphasis are my own):\nANATOLY GOLITSYN, now an American citizen, is a former major in the\ncounterintelligence service of the KGB, which he joined in 1946. He defected in\nDecember 1961, at the age of 35, from his &quot;cover&quot; assignment as vice consul at the\nSoviet Embassy in Helsinki. He lived in England until August 1963, when he left for the\nUnited States. Here Anatoly Golitsyn worked for the CIA under the vigorous\nsponsorship of James Angleton, for twenty years head of counterintelligence until he\nwas fired in December 1974 by the then CIA Director William Colby.\n(RogerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s note: There is strong evidence that William Colby, who became head of\nthe CIA, was in actuality a Russian Spy. This would be consistent with\nGolitsynsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ accusations that the CIA was riddled with Russian Spies from top to\nbottom. Former CIA director Richard Helms, James Angleton and others were\nconvinced he was a spy, and went public with their assertions (leaking it to the\npress) when Colby was actually appointed as the CIA director...and when they\ncould get no investigations started within the intelligence community. As Richard\nHelms told his biographer, ColbyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s acts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œas Director of Central Intelligence were\nentirely consistent with those of a man who was a Russian agent.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ As the\ninvestigation started to heat up, Colby resigned as director and then died\nmysteriously in a canoe accident. It was Colby who helped dismantle the CIA...DOWNLOAD THE TORRENT.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://g-r-i.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://g-r-i.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe websites of Joe Blow: \n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.concen.cc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.concen.cc&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.umunu.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.umunu.com&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.umu.mu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.umu.mu&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSend tips to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;ef85808a8d838098af9a829a819ac18c8082&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; or call skype:joeblowman\t\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82382e7226f6d08da76cb450eb60ee4d3968ecae","amp;dn":"%5Bwww.concen.cc%5D+RUSSIAN+EXPANSIONISM+The+Russian+Endgame+Strateg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82382e7226f6d08da76cb450eb60ee4d3968ecae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,56,46,114,38,246,208,141,167,108,180,80,235,96,238,77,57,104,236,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
