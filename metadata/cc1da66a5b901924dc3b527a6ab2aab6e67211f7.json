Whether treating the homeless woman in front of the hospital like a human \nbeing or trying to talk a suicidal cancer patient off the ledge, Christina must challenge hospital \nadministrators, heartless doctors, apathetic colleagues and a system that sometimes \nforgets it's there to serve the sick.\n\nRecently widowed and the mother of a smart, willful teenager, Christina juggles her career with \nher equally important role as a single parent. Between the two, she barely has time for herself \nand has difficulty keeping things together. But she knows she has to and can't give up on anyone. \nThat's what her passion requires; it's what it takes to be a hero. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tvrage.com/Hawthorne&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tvrage.com/Hawthorne&lt;/a&gt; \n                        \n         \n          \n                         Big up all scene massive! \n       \n        \n\n                                                                 \n                            GROUP INFORMATION\n                            \n                  9 Years of the Force and still going strong\n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios/Cable x264 rippers or cappers\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;30765f42535570584543581e5159&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc1da66a5b901924dc3b527a6ab2aab6e67211f7","amp;dn":"Hawthorne.S02E04.HDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc1da66a5b901924dc3b527a6ab2aab6e67211f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,29,166,106,91,144,25,36,220,59,82,122,106,178,170,182,230,114,17,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
