The original game, Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven, had a screenplay of 400 pages\ncompared to the 700 pages of the sequel. Daniel VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡vra, the writer and director of the original and the sequel, discussed the new angle of the game stating\nThe old game was a tribute to gangster films, a romantic vision. Mafia II is grittier, real, a darker world, and the effects are based in reality Official PlayStation Magazine state \nA high body count is still promised in this tale set in a fictional city inspired by' New York of the 1940s and \\'50s, but those casualties will come the hard way ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ through small-scale operations rather than mass firefights.\n\n Reference to Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven\n\nIn the original game the main protagonist Thomas Angelo is shown to be gunned down at the end of the game in front of his house. It is revealed in Chapter 14: Stairway to Heaven in Mafia 2 that Vito and Joe are the two who \\&quot;whack\\&quot; him. \nThis is further proven by the use of the exact same red car in both cases and nearly identical cut scenes, although the dialogue used is the same from the original scene. The cut scene uses the same voice actor for Thomas Angelo as in the original game, Michael Sorvino.\n\nseed and Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:167b48d60fc4ad6d1518b848fb6de572b2f5d952","amp;dn":"Mafia+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"167b48d60fc4ad6d1518b848fb6de572b2f5d952","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,123,72,214,15,196,173,109,21,24,184,72,251,109,229,114,178,245,217,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
