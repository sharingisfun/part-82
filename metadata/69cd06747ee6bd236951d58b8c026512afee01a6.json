But who cares? This is Rob Zombie! Even if he put his own line of dog food out there I would buy it all. But really, you are all probably wondering whatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s so different about this third compilation album? I know I was. So if you have a few minutes, I would like to show you around Rob ZombieÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Icon 2, in stores now.\n\nFirst off, I know every Zombie fan out there is probably a bit confused over the fact that Geffen Records released this. ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s only natural to exhibit this confusion. After all, him leaving Geffen late last year and signing with Roadrunner Records delayed the release of my favorite album of the year so far, Hellbilly Deluxe 2, not to be confused with the upcoming special edition reissue of Hellbilly Deluxe 2 on September 28th. Confused yet? I am a little bit with this next statement. While this compilation contains several tracks that were not on his previous two greatest hit albums, most notably ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe One,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMeet The Creeper,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFoxy FoxyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAmerican Witch,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ it also contains three tracks from his latest Roadrunner RecordsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ CD, Hellbilly Deluxe 2. How did that work out? My best guess is that there must have been some behind-the-scenes kind of deal where Geffen still kind of half owns these tracks too since the album was originally supposed to come out on their label anyway in late 2009. I think.\n\nSo as you might expect, the compilation pretty much takes us on a journey from the early success of White Zombie (the historic tracks that provoked my interest in Ford Mustangs) all the way to RobÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s most recent solo project, Hellbilly Deluxe 2, whose full title is actually Hellbilly Deluxe 2: Noble Jackals, Penny Dreadfuls and the Systematic Dehumanization of Cool. Wow! ThatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s a long title, huh? I took the liberty of listing all the titles you will find on the 2-disc set below. Oddly enough, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMars Needs WomenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is actually the unreleased version of the song, without the long acoustic intro, thatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s scheduled to be released on the September 28th special edition reissue of Hellbilly Deluxe 2. Geez! This all makes your head hurt if you think about it too much, doesnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t it?\n\nRob_Zombie-Icon_2-2CD-2010-VAG\n\nAlbum: Icon 2\nYear: 2010\nGenre: Metal\n\nTracklist:\n\nCD1\n\n1/12.
