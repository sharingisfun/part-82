Sorry about the quality; it was obviously ripped from an analog TV source, and it shows. However, if you're interested in this stuff, it's worthwhile. It was rebroadcast recently on History Channel; if it comes up again I'll try to get a better rip.\n\nMore info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_Maskelyne","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1183b57ba1c7646bb2412a486d1a9a19d25f090b","amp;dn":"History%5C%27s+Mysteries+S10E08++-+The+War+Illusionist","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1183b57ba1c7646bb2412a486d1a9a19d25f090b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,131,181,123,161,199,100,107,178,65,42,72,109,26,154,25,210,95,9,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
