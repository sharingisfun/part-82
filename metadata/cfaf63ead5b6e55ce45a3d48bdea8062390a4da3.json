Jimmy's youthful good looks and constantly sunny disposition attracted comparisons with Jamie Oliver (an old friend, who partly-funded the purchase of the farm in the first place).\nThe first (2004) short-run season (four episodes) was followed up with a one-off special, Back on Jimmy's Farm, in 2005, and two further 4-part series, titled Return to Jimmy's Farm (2006) and Crisis on Jimmy's Farm (2007). 30-minute edits from the first season were aired under the title Jimmy's Farm Diaries.\n\nEpisode 1\n\nBattling to keep his dream on track, Jimmy has to learn to be the boss as staff grow restless. He also struggles to keep his favourite pig alive. And there's a visit from the police to deal with.\n\n##########AVI Information\nFilename: BBC.Jimmy's.Farm.Series.2.1of4.January.2005.avi\nFilesize: 540580248 Bytes (515,54 MB)\nStreams (i.e. Video, Audio): 2\n##########Video Stream\nCompression: divx - DivX\nAvg.
