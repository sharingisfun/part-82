The show was notable for its frequent use of clips from old movies to express Martin's inner life and feelings, which lent it much of its quirky appeal. The flashbacks of old film and television show scenes also had the immediate appeal, reminding viewers about the impact of TV on their consciousness. The show is primarily significant, however, for being one of the first American sitcoms (Showtime's Brothers and Steambath preceded this show by several years) to use cursing and nudity, uncensored. This was possible because it was on a pay-cable channel, rather than free network TV.\nDream On first aired July 1990 on HBO, and was cancelled by HBO in March 1996.\n\nfrom Wikipedia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d028a828a8bbbb9da7437638190469a049eef39","amp;dn":"Dream+On+Season+1+Episode+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d028a828a8bbbb9da7437638190469a049eef39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,2,138,130,138,139,187,185,218,116,55,99,129,144,70,154,4,158,239,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
