Originally set to be released in early 2009 before several delays, the album was produced primarily by Cool &amp; Dre, DJ Infamous, DJ Nasty &amp; LVM, Kevin Rudolf, and J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League. Rebirth was promoted as Wayne's rock music debut, though it includes some hip hop tracks.\n\nThe album debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling 176,000 copies in its first week. It became Wayne's seventh top-ten album in the United States and produced four singles that attained Billboard chart success. Upon its release, Rebirth received generally negative reviews from most music critics. It has been certified gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America, with domestic shipment of 500,000 copies.\n\n\nReleased \tFebruary 2, 2010\nRecorded \t2008-2009\n\nTrack Listing:\n1. \t&quot;American Star&quot; (featuring Shanell)\n2. \t&quot;Prom Queen&quot; (featuring Shanell)\n3. \t&quot;Ground Zero&quot;\n4. \t&quot;Da Da Da&quot;\n5. \t&quot;Paradice&quot;\n6. \t&quot;Get a Life&quot;\n7. \t&quot;On Fire&quot; \n8. \t&quot;Drop the World&quot; (featuring Eminem)\n9. \t&quot;Runnin'&quot; (featuring Shanell)\n10. \t&quot;One Way Trip&quot; (featuring Kevin Rudolf)\n11. \t&quot;Knockout&quot; (featuring Nicki Minaj)\n12. \t&quot;The Price is Wrong&quot;  \n\nDeluxe edition bonus tracks:\n13. \t&quot;I'll Die for You&quot;\n14. \t&quot;I'm So Over You&quot; (featuring Shanell)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:195edfc234a17d29c27678671542ea2865d6aa51","amp;dn":"Lil+Wayne+-+Rebirth+%5BDeluxe+Edition%5D+HQ+-+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"195edfc234a17d29c27678671542ea2865d6aa51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,94,223,194,52,161,125,41,194,118,120,103,21,66,234,40,101,214,170,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
