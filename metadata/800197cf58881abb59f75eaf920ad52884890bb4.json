I gave it five stars, but it isn't \n\na five star cd. The five stars are there because this cd changed my \n\nlife. It opened a whole new door to me, and for that I'll always be \n\nthankful for this cd. This collection may not have the same effect on \n\nyou, but you never know. To those unfamiliar, yet curious about Zappa, \n\nI'm sure it must be frustrating standing in the record store staring \n\ndown hundreds of Zappa albums and thinking, &quot;My God, which one do I \n\nget?&quot; Well, this collection(one of the first Zappa collections to come \n\nout) is a good place to start, but be forewarned: It is misleading. \n\nTrying to cram 60 albums' worth of music on one cd is an impossible \n\ntask, especially from an artist who experimented with so many sounds. \n\nThis compilation exists in a fantasy world where all the songs on the \n\ndisc would be Frank Zappa's hit singles. As we all know, he didn't \n\nhave hit singles, but if he did, these would be it. That's where it's \n\nmisleading coz Zappa's music goes way beyond what you'll hear on this \n\ncd. Most of the tunes here are kept to 4 minute, humorous, catchy rock \n\ntunes that make Zappa sound like Weird Al with much better guitar \n\nplaying ability. Gone are the modern classical pieces, the free jazz, \n\nthe ten minute guitar solos and the crude humor. Yes folks, you won't \n\nhear it on Strictly Commercial, but Zappa said things that would make \n\nThe Insane Clown Posse blush. So, I would suggest this compilation \n\njust to get a fair idea of what Zappa's about, though many \n\ncompilations have been released since(ones that include the offensive \n\nstuff). So, if you like what you hear on this cd, this can open the \n\ndoor to the Zappa Universe(and it's a huge one) for you, and you'll be \n\nquite surprised at all the wonderful things you'll find there. Then, \n\nonce you get some albums, you probably won't ever listen to this disc \n\nagain, but you'll be forever thankful that you took the gamble and \n\nbought it. \n\n\n1.
