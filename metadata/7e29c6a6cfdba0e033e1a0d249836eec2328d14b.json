This CD is packed with four major key genres Classic Electronic Poppy Crunkness. At only 16 years old this rising talented young boy is going places. With 8 tracks all ranging from different sounds and genres made with beautiful synthesizers and a sound that can only be described as what you would find at the depths of the deepest trenches. Full of wonder, life, heart, and creativity. This mixtape will hit every sense of emotion you have. Sadness, loving, to downright crunk and gorgeous. Piano melody's out of this world. No wonder the young boy is creating a stir in the big city of Dallas Texas.
