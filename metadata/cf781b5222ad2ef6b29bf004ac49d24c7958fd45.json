The single was also a top fifty hit in the UK. &quot;Shine&quot; failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe song originally was made for the original soundtrack to the movie The Fighting Temptations, but failed to make the final cut. The clue for this is in the first verse, where the title to the movie is mentioned.\n\nThe Ultimate Luther Vandross is a greatest hits album by American R&amp;B/soul singer Luther Vandross, released in 2001. The compilation was re-released in 2006 with a different tracklisting, along with two previously unreleased songs.\n\nLuther Vandross (April 20, 1951 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ July 1, 2005) was an American R&amp;B and soul singer-songwriter, and record producer. During his career, Vandross sold over twenty-five million albums[2] and won eight Grammy Awards including Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance four times. He won four Grammy Awards in 2004 including the Grammy Award for Song of the Year for the track &quot;Dance with My Father&quot;, co-written with Richard Marx.\n\nLuther Vandross finally made his long desired career breakthrough as a featured singer with the vaunted pop-dance act Change, a studio concept created by French-Italian businessman Jacques Fred Petrus. Their 1980 hits, &quot;A Lover's Holiday&quot; (by Romani and Willoughby), &quot;The Glow of Love&quot; (by Romani, Malavasi and Garfield) and &quot;Searching&quot; (by Malavasi), of which Vandross sang on all three, opened up the world for Vandross. And there was no doubt about whether Vandross liked the song &quot;The Glow of Love&quot;. In an interview that Vibe Magazine did with him in 2001 Vandross said, &quot;This is the most beautiful song I've ever sung in my life.&quot; Vandross was also originally intended to perform on the second and highly successful Change  album &quot;Miracles&quot; in 1981, but declined the offer as Petrus didn't pay enough money. Vandross' decision rapidly led to a recording contract with Epic Records  that same year but didn't stop him from doing some background vocals on &quot;Miracles&quot; and on the new Petrus created act, NYC band, The B. B. &amp; Q. band in 1981. During that hectic year Vandross jump-started his second attempt at a solo career with his debut album, Never Too Much. In addition to the hit title track it contained a version of the Burt Bacharach / Hal David song &quot;A House Is Not a Home&quot;. The song &quot;Never Too Much&quot;, written by himself, reaching number-one on the R&amp;B charts. This period also marked the beginning of frequent songwriting collaboration with bassist Marcus Miller, who played on many of the tracks and would also produce or co-produce a number of tracks for Vandross. The Never Too Much album was arranged by high school classmate Nat Adderley, Jr., a collaboration that would last through Vandross's career.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf781b5222ad2ef6b29bf004ac49d24c7958fd45","amp;dn":"Luther+Vandross+-+Shine+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf781b5222ad2ef6b29bf004ac49d24c7958fd45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,120,27,82,34,173,46,246,178,155,240,4,172,73,210,76,121,88,253,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
