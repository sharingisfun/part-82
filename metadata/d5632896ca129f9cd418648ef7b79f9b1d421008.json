He's also considered, by many people, the athlete of the century. He's considered to be the most famous person in the world. Everybody who saw him playing say he was some kind of genius of the sport. He could invent plays as no other player ever could. In this documentary, through the eyes of various players and friends, people who couldn't actually see PelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© during his years as a professional player (1957 - 1974), have a chance to see what they have missed. PelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© is still a famous person in Brazil, where he lives (he's 64 years old now). We still see him on TV very often, and his talent survives time thanks to lots of images saved in documentaries like this one.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Pele.Eterno.CD1.2004.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 730,935,296 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:02:37\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.0.1\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x336 (AR: 1.905)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1097 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.213 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 448 kb/s [6 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n____________________________\n\nFile Name .........................................: Pele.Eterno.CD2.2004.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 716,021,760 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 58:33.941\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.0.1\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x336 (AR: 1.905)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1174 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.228 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 448 kb/s [6 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
