At yesterdayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s town hall meeting, a Wall Street hedge fund manager told President Obama about the suffering his people undergo. He said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI represent the Wall Street community. We have felt like a piÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ata.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  I know he was trying to be self-pitying, but the piÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ata analogy is actually illustrative in a number of ways. Wall Street types ARE like a piÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ata. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re stuffed full of sweets while the rest of us are hungry. And the similarities donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop there. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re suspended high above the rest of us. And now it looks like their plan is to have themselves hauled up even higher so theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re completely out of the reach of all of us blindfolded little children down below. Wall Street is also like a piÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ata in the sense that all of the goodies are sealed up in this artificial construction where they canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do anybody any good. And now Wall Street wants to take all the rest of the candy and seal that up in piÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±atas too, so they can sit on it to ride their way through this recession.\n\nPiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±atas are made to be opened up eventually, you jerks! ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re at the party in the first place. If this hedge fund moron was putting together a childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s birthday party, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d have the piÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ata out of reach for the kiddies the entire time. And what would you have then? A full piÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ata and a bunch of crying children. Happy Birthday! OK, at this point, the analogy breaks down, because now itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the people who have the piÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ata all sealed up for themselves who are whining and crying. Half of the little kids who canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get at the piÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ata donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even know whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going on. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re just walking around blindfolded by entities like Fox News and FreedomWorks, swinging their sticks in whatever direction theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re told to.\n\nThe hedge fund guy had gone to law school with Barack Obama. Now heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a hedge fund manager, and Obama is President of the United States. Thank God that President Obama told this moron that if heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s making a billion dollars a year while so many people are out of work, maybe he shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t feel so put upon. This manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s secretary pays higher taxes than he does. And he probably had her write up the questions he wanted to whack Obama with at this town meetingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the questions about how poor hedge fund managers are always getting beat up on. Enjoy the whine. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more where that came from","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4df77710ea3047d64e82f113732608e3c3274a9d","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+September+21+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4df77710ea3047d64e82f113732608e3c3274a9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,247,119,16,234,48,71,214,78,130,241,19,115,38,8,227,195,39,74,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
