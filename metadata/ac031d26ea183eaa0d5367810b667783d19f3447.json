It stars Ray Milland as a retired tennis pro who wishes to have his wife killed, Grace Kelly as the wife, and Robert Cummings as her paramour. The supporting cast includes John Williams as the police detective who investigates the matter and Anthony Dawson as the man hired to do the killing.\n\nThe screenplay and the stage play on which it was based were both written by English playwright Frederick Knott (1916ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2002), whose work tends to focus on women who innocently become the potential victims of sinister plots. The original play premiered in 1952 on BBC television, before being performed on the stage in the same year (West End in June, and then Broadway in October).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac031d26ea183eaa0d5367810b667783d19f3447","amp;dn":"Hitchcock+and+Dial+M+%5B2003%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac031d26ea183eaa0d5367810b667783d19f3447","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,3,29,38,234,24,62,170,13,83,103,129,11,102,119,131,209,159,52,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
