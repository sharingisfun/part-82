Byzantino is the most listened to track on last.fm, and is light-gabber. I'd say my favorite would be The Ray of Sunlight, which is a happy-hardcore track, followed by Place 2 Place, also happy-hardcore.\n\n01. Place 2 Place\n02. Sweet and Sour\n03. Miss You\n04. Surreal\n05. strange muzik\n06. The Seek of Yourself\n07. Attack to my dream\n08. Byzantino\n09. Conclude (P*Light Remix)\n10.
