HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s talking about public sector unions. Their pay and benefits have risen astronomically, and you get to pay the bill.\n\nBut NY Transit Union boss, John Samuelsen argues, we are the richest country in the world and can afford it.  Really?\n\nHere are some of the facts;\n\nPublic pensions have unfunded liability of $1 trillion to $3.5 trillion\n\nFederal workers take home twice pay and benefits as private workers. Local and state workers also make more.\n\nTotal          Pay           Benefits\n\nPrivate                 $59,909      $50,028         $9,881\n\nLocal/state        $67,812      $52,051        $15,761\n\nFederal               $119,982     $79,197        $40,785\n\n-- Average TWU union worker makes $60K without overtime or benefits.\n\n-- 25% took 15 or more sick days.  Average was 8 sick days.\n\n-- Fox average 3 sick days (same for men and women)\n\n-- No FOX employee took 15 days\n\nRelative Danger of Jobs (Deaths per 100,000 workers)\n\n-- Fishing      128.9\n\n--Logging     115.7\n\n--Iron workers  46.4\n\n--Farmers       39.5\n\n--Firemen   3.8\n\n--Transit workers 1.4\n\n(Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, except Transit worker death, that is from interview with TWU Local100 President)\n\nSome people argue that thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no alternative to the government monopoly on municipal work, but Sandy Springs, Georgia, privatized most of itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s jobs in 2005.  Now the city pays about Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ of what it used to pay.  It enjoys a $14 million surplus, in addition to funding a $20 million reserve.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5e3b78a67342cba89af25343ba2749a2d0a1148","amp;dn":"20100925-The+Battle+for+the+Future-with+John+Stossel.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5e3b78a67342cba89af25343ba2749a2d0a1148","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,227,183,138,103,52,44,186,137,175,37,52,59,162,116,154,45,10,17,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
