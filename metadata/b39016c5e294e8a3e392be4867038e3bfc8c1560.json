Adam (John Cusack), Lou (Rob Corddry), Nick (Craig Robinson), and Jacob (Clark Duke) have all seen better days; Adam's and Nick's love lives are in the dumps, Lou is clinging to his hard-partying past, and video-game addict Jacob can't even muster the courage to walk outside. A fun stay at the ski resort where the gang made some of their best memories seems like just the thing to cheer everyone up, but after a night of heavy drinking in the hot tub, the four friends wake up to find they're about to live through the '80s a second time. Determined not to make the same mistakes twice, Adam, Lou, Nick, and Jacob decide to take full advantage of the unique opportunity presented to them, and create the lives they've always wanted","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b39016c5e294e8a3e392be4867038e3bfc8c1560","amp;dn":"Hot+Tub+Time+Machine+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b39016c5e294e8a3e392be4867038e3bfc8c1560","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,144,22,197,226,148,232,163,227,146,190,72,103,3,142,59,252,140,21,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
