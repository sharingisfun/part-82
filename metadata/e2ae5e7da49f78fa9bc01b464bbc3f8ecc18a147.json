The theme of the album is misplacement in space. If there were no space, everything would be at the same point, packed together like matter in a black hole. Extremely dense and with collected sounds from various instruments crashed together at high speeds, this is the album equivalent of a pitch black room with lightning as the only source of light. Noises and reverberations from non-euclidean structures are strictly systematised and condensed into a groove that shifts in dimension, from one particle to a galaxy in the blink of an eye. In this space-less space, the music tries to sound like the music of the real world, like a tree resembling a crooked man, a dragon seen in clouds, or a face seen on the surface of a stone.\nTracklist:\n\n1.
