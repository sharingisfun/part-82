Who you are.&quot;\n\nAn undercover cop finds that the line between his own personality\nand that of the character he's created have begun to dangerously\nblur in this drama. John (Reece Dinsdale) is a British police detective\nwhose skill is matched only by his arrogance. Acts of brutal\nhooliganism have become commonplace at the football matches featuring one of London's\nminor league teams, Shadwell Town, and the police suspect that there is a more criminal\nundercurrent to these actions than merely fandom gone wrong\nafter a few pints of beer. So John is made part of an undercover\nteam along with Trevor (Richard Graham) and two other officers;\nthey are to blend in with the most rabid fans and learn what is\nbehind the violence. John also makes the acquaintance of Lydia\n(Saskia Reeves), a barmaid at a pub where many of the hooligans hang out, he and\nbecomes friendly with her as a way of obtaining more information. But as John sinks deeper\ninto a life of alcohol and violence while hanging out with the Shadwell Town hooligans,\nhe finds he likes it more and more, and in time, he finds that he's becoming one of the\nbrutal thugs he set out to capture. He also finds his relationship with Lydia is no longer\njust a matter of business, much to the chagrin of his wife Marie (Claire Skinner). I.D.\nmarked the feature debut for British director Philip Davis, who also directed several\ndistinguished productions for U.K. television. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/71594944276571371340.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/71594944276571371340.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/21461661672501105751.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/21461661672501105751.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/03049424577161455639.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/03049424577161455639.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113375/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113375/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef67721c1721ce9b5c9eef78d6ba8ef8a552c174","amp;dn":"I.D.+1994+dvdrip+Xvid+%5BBig+A+Little+A%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef67721c1721ce9b5c9eef78d6ba8ef8a552c174","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,103,114,28,23,33,206,155,92,158,239,120,214,186,142,248,165,82,193,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
