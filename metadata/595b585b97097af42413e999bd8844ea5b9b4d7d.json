As one of German dictator Adolf Hitler's closest associates and most devout followers, he was known for his zealous oratory and anti-Semitism. He was the chief architect of the Kristallnacht attack on the German Jews, which historians consider to be the beginning of the Final Solution, leading towards the genocide of the Holocaust.\n\nGoebbels earned a Ph.D. from Heidelberg University in 1921, writing his doctoral thesis on 18th century romantic drama; he then went on to work as a journalist and later a bank clerk and caller on the stock exchange. He also wrote novels and plays, but they were rejected by publishers. Goebbels came into contact with the Nazi Party in 1923 during the French occupation of the Ruhr and became a member in 1924. He was appointed Gauleiter (regional party leader) of Berlin. In this position, he put his propaganda skills to full use, combating the local socialist and communist parties with the help of Nazi papers and the paramilitary Stormtroopers, aka, Brownshirts, SA. By 1928, he had risen in the party ranks to become one of its most prominent members.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458375/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458375/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/3470/goebbelsbiographyavisna.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/3470/goebbelsbiographyavisna.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/3470/goebbelsbiographyavisna.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/3470/goebbelsbiographyavisna.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/3470/goebbelsbiographyavisna.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/3470/goebbelsbiographyavisna.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/3470/goebbelsbiographyavisna.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/3470/goebbelsbiographyavisna.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCheck Out My Other Torrents\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/vicerock/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/vicerock/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:595b585b97097af42413e999bd8844ea5b9b4d7d","amp;dn":"Goebles+Biography.XviD...vice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"595b585b97097af42413e999bd8844ea5b9b4d7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,91,88,91,151,9,122,244,36,19,233,153,189,136,68,234,91,155,77,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
