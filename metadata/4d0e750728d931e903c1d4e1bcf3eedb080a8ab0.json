Basically the president wants to be able to shut down the peoples ability to share information. Check the stories:\n\nhttp\nhttp\nhttp\nhttp\nhttp\n\nRemove the space after the http.\n\nI have now heard that the senate has dropped the &quot;Internet Kill Switch&quot; bill due to the large opportunity for the power to be abused. Lets hope that is the case, but lets also keep our eyes on our government.\nThe Obama administration has announced that they are going to start going after the pirate community, (**EDIT As of July 13th, at least ten sites have had their URL seized. Their equipment seized. Their owners/operators arrested.) they are not talking about Somalian pirates, they are talking about us. So, if you value this freedom that we all enjoy, write your local leaders and tell them so. They are supposed to work for us, not the other way around. If you don't live in the US and think &quot;So what? Let the stupid Americans do what they want.&quot; Remember that what we are doing today your country may be doing tomorrow, so **BEWARE**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d0e750728d931e903c1d4e1bcf3eedb080a8ab0","amp;dn":"Opie+and+Anthony+2010-07-15-O%26A-CF64K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d0e750728d931e903c1d4e1bcf3eedb080a8ab0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,14,117,7,40,217,49,233,3,193,212,225,188,243,238,219,8,10,138,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
