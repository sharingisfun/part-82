The villagers ostracize Naruto because the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox, a malevolent creature that attacked Konohagakure, is sealed within his body. \n\nAs such, Naruto has ambitions of becoming the village's leader, the Hokage, in order to gain recognition amongst his peers. Nonetheless, Naruto maintains a cheerful and boisterous personality, allowing him to befriend several other Konoha ninja throughout the series, as well as ninja from other villages. He builds an especially close relationship with Team 7, the ninja team where he belongs, treating them as his family.\n\nPlease Seed !!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53cf1e975bd2c0e1b832f2f502ea18d8b238a89c","amp;dn":"Naruto+Shippuunden+1+-+169+EN+Subbed+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53cf1e975bd2c0e1b832f2f502ea18d8b238a89c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,207,30,151,91,210,192,225,184,50,242,245,2,234,24,216,178,56,168,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
