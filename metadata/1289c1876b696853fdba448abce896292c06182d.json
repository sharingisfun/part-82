To her dismay, he brings a bride: an American widow who races cars. The bride, Larita, thinks she and John will visit and then go to London, where he'll work and she'll race. But John is to the manor born, and mother is nothing if not a master at plans and manipulation. Soon it's all-out war between mother and bride, with John's father, a burnt out veteran of the Great War, in the bride's corner ineffectually. Mother has a plan to join with the neighboring estate; only Larita is in her way. Can't we all get along?&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1289c1876b696853fdba448abce896292c06182d","amp;dn":"Easy+Virtue+%282008%29+-+dvdrip+-+arabic+subs+hardcoded","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1289c1876b696853fdba448abce896292c06182d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,137,193,135,107,105,104,83,253,186,68,138,188,232,150,41,44,6,24,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
