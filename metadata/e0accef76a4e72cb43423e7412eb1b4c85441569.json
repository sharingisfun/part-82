I re ripped the dvd, and the same thing happened, so I remade the torrent.  for those downloading priorly, just point this download to the same directory and files.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nMessage from KingTurd:\n\nHi Bungholes!\n\nThis is the 2nd Edition of my B&amp;B collection. It has some improvements, e.g. approx. 35 episodes are in much better quality\nthan before (using recently obtained hi-qual no-logo VHS captures) and the menus are a bit \\&quot;enhanced\\&quot;...or something. Anyway, I thought it\\'s a good opportunity to update it again, since some\nof the demonoid trackers have died and the torrents needed to be uploaded all over again anyway. As always, please keep in mind: \n\nThe KingTurd DVD-Collection is PUBLIC DOMAIN! Please keep it shared!!\n\nIf I see my collection anywhere on sale, I\\'m gonna find you and beat the living crap out of you...or something! \nSeriously....respect my efforts in stitching this series back together and continue my mission of making this set available without profit to all the fans, like yourself, who were\ndisappointed by the greedy, corporate MTV/Paramount/Viacom asswipes, who are trying to make lots of money by feeding us their incomplete\nand censored crap. Don\\'t be like them!\n\nThank You Drive Thru!!\n\nKingTurd\nTexas/USA - Baden/Germany - 2008\n\nPS: Some technical advise regarding burning these DVDs: The torrent includes the DVDs. \nIn order for these discs to play properly on your DVD-player, I recommend you burn these with ImgBurn (freeware) at low speed (6x) and on decent blanks (e.g. Verbatim).\nI tried higher speeds and cheaper blanks and thus created tons of...uhh...beer coasters! Also, when I tried other burn software it\nmessed up the DVD-menu structure. So ImgBurn is the way to go!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0accef76a4e72cb43423e7412eb1b4c85441569","amp;dn":"Beavis+%26+Butt-head+%3A+The+Complete+King+Turd+Collection+V2+%28100%25%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0accef76a4e72cb43423e7412eb1b4c85441569","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,172,206,247,106,78,114,203,67,66,62,116,18,235,27,76,133,68,21,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
