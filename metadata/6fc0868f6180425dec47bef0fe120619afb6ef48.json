Jimmy's youthful good looks and constantly sunny disposition attracted comparisons with Jamie Oliver (an old friend, who partly-funded the purchase of the farm in the first place).\nThe first (2004) short-run season (four episodes) was followed up with a one-off special, Back on Jimmy's Farm, in 2005, and two further 4-part series, titled Return to Jimmy's Farm (2006) and Crisis on Jimmy's Farm (2007). 30-minute edits from the first season were aired under the title Jimmy's Farm Diaries.\n\nEpisode 3\n\nThere's a killer decimating the chickens; Porridge the prize boar is out of control; and 800,000 unruly bees are getting agitated. Jimmy's unfailing optimism is tested to the limit.\n\n##########AVI Information\nFilename: BBC.Jimmy's.Farm.Series.2.3of4.June.2005.avi\nFilesize: 540580248 Bytes (515,54 MB)\nStreams (i.e. Video, Audio): 2\n##########Video Stream\nCompression: divx - DivX\nAvg.
