Lodge\n# Narrated by Don Leslie , Rick Adamson\n\n\n\nYounger Next Year is about how to turn back your biological clock. How to become functionally younger every year for the next five to 10 years, and continue to live with vitality and grace into your 80s and beyond.\n\nHarry's Rules (Harry being Harry S. Lodge, M.D.) are only seven, but they completely reverse the typical path of aging. Exercise six days a week for the rest of your life. Quit eating crap. Connect and commit. And to prove it is his star patient, the no-punches-pulled Chris Crowley, a 70-year-old who left the slippery slope of retirement and turned his life around. Harry tells you what to do. Chris tells you how. And their argument is irresistible.\n\nYou're a guy. You have responsibilities. You think about the future, the 401K, the kids' schools. There's one other thing you can't afford not to think about: yourself. Marrying science and reality, Younger Next Year is a convincing and passionate argument that if you train for the Next Third of life, you'll have a ball. Follow its simple rules and you'll find yourself in perhaps the best shape, in mind, body, and spirit, of your life.
