Awed by his immodest warmth and sex appeal, the conversation lowers to buzz, the barometric pressure rises and the air grows thick with anticipation and want.\n\nKevin Hart is electrifying. Stardom radiates from him like a New York billboard as he lights up the stage and side swaps his audience with his unique comedic humor.\n\nUndaunted by his chances of being accepted on the &quot;tough&quot; comedy circuit, Kevin debuted on amateur night at a Philadelphia comedy club. The audience welcomed him into their hearts and Hart was hooked. Kevin quit his job as a shoe salesman for an athletic shoe store chain and began chasing his dream of becoming a star. Comedy swims through his bloodstream right along side red and white cells.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaab1d65424da85a6c17d6c3d400299b6198400a","amp;dn":"Kevin+Hart+Seriously+Funny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaab1d65424da85a6c17d6c3d400299b6198400a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,171,29,101,66,77,168,90,108,23,214,195,212,0,41,155,97,152,64,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
