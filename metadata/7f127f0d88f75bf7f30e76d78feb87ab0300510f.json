It's his first in 35mm with sound, and the photography (black and white) and mise en scene are quite accomplished if for the most part unspectacular. Several of his trademarks do show up here, including the interest in games and play-acting, conspiracies and young love; also in its use of diagetic sound - as far as I can tell all of the music in the film is by the baroque composer FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Couperin, but it is heard as part of a typical mimetic sound-scheme, played on the piano in the first scene, and played on record in later scenes. The film is framed as a story of a chess-game, narrated briefly at various points by the director who comments on the story in a droll, ironic manner that reminds me more of early Godard than of Rivette's other work.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049095/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049095/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f127f0d88f75bf7f30e76d78feb87ab0300510f","amp;dn":"Le.Coup.du.Berger.1957.DVDRip.XViD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f127f0d88f75bf7f30e76d78feb87ab0300510f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,18,127,13,136,247,91,247,243,14,118,215,143,235,135,171,3,0,81,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
