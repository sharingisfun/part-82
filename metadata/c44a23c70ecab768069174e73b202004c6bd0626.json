But as their summer romance heats up, she has to overcome the concerns of her grandparents about her boyfriend's criminal past.\n\nREVIEW\n\nFirst, this film is not for very young children. Hilary Duff does both producing and starring in this dark comedy about a 17 year old teenager, Greta, from New York City whose sent to exile for the summer with her grandparents played by Ellen Burstyn and Michael Murphy who are divine in their roles. Melissa Leo plays Greta's mother but she's not on long enough and it's a shame because Duff, Leo, and Burstyn have some of their finest scenes together. Anyway, Greta is sent to live in Ocean Grove, New Jersey which is a seaside community and not far from the infamous Asbury Park which was crime ridden and left in ashes. Anyway, Greta gets a job at a restaurant. She is determined to end her life by 18 but things might change her point of view and it might be the best summer she ever had.\n\n\nPLEASE HELP TO SEED AND ENJOY!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c44a23c70ecab768069174e73b202004c6bd0626","amp;dn":"Surviving+Summer+Retail+DVDRIP+2010+SPEEDS%3FRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c44a23c70ecab768069174e73b202004c6bd0626","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,74,35,199,14,202,183,104,6,145,116,231,59,32,32,4,198,189,6,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
