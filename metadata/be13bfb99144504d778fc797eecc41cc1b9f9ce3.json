Trevor likes Stephen King, Amber wants       \n           to be a singer-songwriter, and Rob's into the Chili            \n           Peppers. Amber used to date Trevor but now she's going to      \n           marry Rob. They read the obituaries in order to find           \n           things they can turn into money on the internet. Pretty        \n           soon they end up in the destroyed house of a dead dude         \n           named Bill Zill, and they're also seriously obsessing          \n           over watching a surveillance-cam website called                \n           fourboxes.tv. Fourboxes.tv is a dusty, digital window          \n           into the wacked-out world of a creep they call Havoc.          \n           Havoc didn't know his apartment was wired up when he           \n           moved in. And he's weird. He sleeps in a bat-cage, builds      \n           bombs in a dungeon, and looks like he's planning to kill       \n           people on a seriously massive scale. Trevor, Amber and         \n           Rob decide they have to do something to find and stop          \n           Havoc, wherever he is. Or...maybe not - they could just        \n           keep watching, 'cause, as Rob says, &quot;That's what the           \n           internet's for.&quot; Havoc's dirty, wrecked world couldn't         \n           affect them - right? Safe, alone, deep in the dark,            \n           clean, American suburbs.                                       \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n                  Thanks to our friends at KART3LDVD.
