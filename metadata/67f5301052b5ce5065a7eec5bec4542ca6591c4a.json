Very well developed, blending together a ton of styles with everything from uplifting trance to some jaw-droppingly hard house and happy hardcore. A pretty enjoyable album, on the lighter and more friendly side of JCore music. I think it's one of M-Project's better albums, and it really depends on your tastes. If you like sophisticated, emotion-inducing, and complex arrangements, this is likely not the album for you. If you enjoy simple, fun, bouncy patterns with creative synths, then give it a check.\n\nRecommended tracks:\nAfter World (JAKAZiD's ahhÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â½Ã…Â¾fter world Remix) (Light Trance/Happy-Hardcore), a really fun and uplifting track which I will be blasting out the car stereo for many days to come.\n\nThe Future Is Now (DJ-X LAB4 Remix) (Makina/Hardcore), it draws you in to its epic creamy center of hard dance music.\n\nCloudy Heaven (JORDI K-STANYA Remix) (Light Makina_, once again, really uplifting and entrancing;\n\nGet Naked (Massive Remix) (Hard House), some really powerful mixing and just full of energy.\n\n\n01. The Future is Now\n02. DESIRE (Long Ver.)\n03. Party Longer (Kanji Kinetic Remix)\n04. Rainbow Cyclone (Shingo DJ Remix)\n05. Overpowering Enemies (Protonic Remix)\n06.
