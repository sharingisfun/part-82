It must be said that many of these concertos are a bit lightweight, but they are lively and diverting--and Christopher Hogwood and the baroque-instrument specialists of the Academy of Ancient Music give them accomplished, persuasive performances. Among the tasty confections here are a vigorous concerto for three trumpets; a double concerto for recorder and transverse flute--in the 18th-century context, the old-fashioned and the newfangled side by side; and the &quot;Concerto polonois&quot; for string orchestra without soloists, based on rustic dance music Telemann heard in Poland as a young man. Then there's the gorgeous concerto for flute, oboe d'amore, and viola d'amore (the last two being lower-pitched versions of the oboe and viola): in the hands of Stephen Preston, Clare Shanks, and Monica Huggett, respectively, Telemann's music for these aptly named instruments brings to mind waking up on a bright sunny morning with your true love in your arms.\nMatthew Westphal\n\nmuzik62","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaa46a860a731d0b6d0efb9bb6466c5f75c8ead1","amp;dn":"Telemann+-+Double+%26+Triple+Concertos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaa46a860a731d0b6d0efb9bb6466c5f75c8ead1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,164,106,134,10,115,29,11,109,14,251,155,182,70,108,95,117,200,234,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
