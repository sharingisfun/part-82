Suddenly he's on the front page and every salesman is at his      \n    doorstep. He loses his job and a day later asks her to call off the      \n    ruse; she tricks him again and the publicity continues. She stays        \n    cheerful and resourceful through a series of misadventures that has      \n    him alternately back on his job and fired. Meanwhile, a count who's      \n    her ex-fianc shows up in New York, and maybe that marriage is back      \n    on. Can an heiress be a human being, and can a reporter get a scoop?     \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
