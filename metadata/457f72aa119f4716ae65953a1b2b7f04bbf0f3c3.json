Taylor put the band together in 2009 but she is the only original member to still remain.\n\n&quot;Make Me Wanna Die&quot; is a strong and powerful 2010 rock anthem which grows on you the more you listen with its catchy chorus, strong drum beats and guitar pieces and layered vocals in the latter end of the song. It's also very well written; Taylor and Ben did a beautiful job on it and I think, after playing the New York live track from a while it makes the perfect first commercial single for the band.&quot; - BUZZSUGAR\n\n*****************************************************************\n\n&quot;I think it's nice for kids who hate Justin Bieber's guts to have someone else to like in music - that person is Taylor Momsen from The Pretty Reckless.\n\nMilky Tea Kid got a Sneak Peek of the soon to be released debut album from The Pretty Reckless called Light Me Up. This album is fundamentally a hard hitting rock album although the softer side of rock is shown in Nothing Left To Lose and You with slower tempos and a string section.\n\nThe debut single, Make Me Wanna Die was featured on the Kick Ass movie soundtrack and was the break through to the mainstream for the band, with the second single Miss Nothing being played on Radio 1 in the UK. This second single continues the hard pop rock vibe with lyrics reflecting lead singer Taylor Momsen's attitude. Momsen is better known for her role in hit TV show Gossip Girl as Little Jenny Humphrey - my my how she has changed and only 17!\n\nMy Medicine and the title track Light Me Up are interesting insights into the mind of the lead singer who writes all of the songs - I would imagine with some other talented musicians and producers.\n\nShe has been compared to Courtney Love too many times to count but I have to say that even though her look might be similar, and she may have got into sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll years ago, I prefer The Pretty Reckless' music to Courtney LoveÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s.\n\nNothing Left To Lose is a great down tempo rock song with lyrics like:\n'Lost between Elvis and suicide, ever since the day we died, well I've got nothing left to lose. After Jesus and rock &amp; roll, couldn't save my immortal soul, I've got nothing left to lose.'\n\nAll in all a good pop hard rock record, I say pop because it is a bit too catchy and sing along to be just plain rock in my opinion - don't yell at me!  You should give it a listen.&quot; - MILKY TEA KID\n\n******************************************************************\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              \n .-.                          \n |                 o          \n-|-.-.  .--. .,-.  .  .--..-. \n |(   ) |  | |   ) |  |  (.-' \n ' `-'`-'  `-|`-'-' `-'   `--'\n             |                \n             '   \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n*******************************************************************\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:457f72aa119f4716ae65953a1b2b7f04bbf0f3c3","amp;dn":"The+Pretty+Reckless+-+Light+Me+Up+%28FULL+ALBUM%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"457f72aa119f4716ae65953a1b2b7f04bbf0f3c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,127,114,170,17,159,71,22,174,101,149,58,27,43,127,4,187,240,243,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
