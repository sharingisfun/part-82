Audio is not awesome but it's pretty good.\n\nVideo was pretty orange all over, had many different colour problems but the main was the orange tan look. So i changed all the colors trying to keep colour into the movie, yet remove as much orange as i could, to me i removed most of it, but theirs still a fair bit their, but viewing trailers seems some of the movie is supposed to be like it, i tweaked the hue a fair bit, and changed the brightness and contrast. i didn't make it any darker just increased brightness and then lowered contrast to balance it. Changed a few other bits also, but to me this looks good enough for the select few :). \n\nThanks to Blihre for the audio!\n\ncredit PrisM &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, extremezone, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic, FASAMOO, W1CK3D1NT3Z, GRIND3R &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img638/736/2lktwgk.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img638/736/2lktwgk.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/4361/15drkuw.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/4361/15drkuw.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/8982/30dl6rk.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/8982/30dl6rk.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img143/2782/2l4ca8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img143/2782/2l4ca8.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/788/5mxshz.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/788/5mxshz.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img822/8895/68bpfm.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img822/8895/68bpfm.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img3/1985/96bx2p.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img3/1985/96bx2p.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDON'T THANK ME...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7ee7c22970b766bdc03edf8e91922635522a56d","amp;dn":"The.Sorcerers.Apprentice.TS.NEW.AUDIO.XviD-PrisM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7ee7c22970b766bdc03edf8e91922635522a56d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,238,124,34,151,11,118,107,220,3,237,248,233,25,34,99,85,34,165,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
