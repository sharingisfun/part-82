The Sullivan family are an old family of werewolf hunters, who have lived with a nearby pack of werewolves in an uneasy truce for several years. That calm is broken by the ascendance of the werewolf Gabriel, who has the ability to shapeshift anytime, not merely during the full moon. He seizes control of the pack and a nearby abandoned town, in addition to biting Nathan. Red's werewolf mythology includes the twist that if the werewolf sire is killed before the next full moon, then the person with the bite won't turn into a werewolf, adding some measure of tension to the proceedings. If you liked her character in Dollhouse, most of Red will be pleasantly familiar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a294012d62808a1601aee957849d812e27261b6","amp;dn":"Red.Werewolf.Hunter.2010.480p.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a294012d62808a1601aee957849d812e27261b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,41,64,18,214,40,8,161,96,26,238,149,120,73,216,18,226,114,97,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
