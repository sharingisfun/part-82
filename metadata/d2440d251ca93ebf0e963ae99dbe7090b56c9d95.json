As much as Blair tries to distract \nherself from the pain Chuck caused her, his \nmysterious appearance in Paris with a \nbeautiful new woman (guest star Cl mence Po\nsy) will force both of them to face what \nhappened. Meanwhile, a newly single Serena \n(Blake Lively) has been enjoying a Parisian \nsummer of love with boys, Blair and \nBalenciaga as she tries to avoid the \ninevitable decision about which of her two \nlong-time beaus, Dan or Nate (Penn Badgley \nand Chace Crawford), she should return to. \nBack on the Upper East Side, Nate meets an \nintriguing girl, Juliet (guest star Katie \nCassidy, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;), who helps him \nrealize that his summer of sexual conquests \nwith the help of Chuck's little black book \nwas his way of avoiding his unresolved \nfeelings for Serena. Meanwhile, Dan's (Penn \nBadgley) baby mama drama continues with \nGeorgina (guest star Michelle Trachtenberg). \nFinally, the van der Woodsen apartment is \nbuzzing with activity as the &quot;Fashion's \nNight Out&quot; event is planned.\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2440d251ca93ebf0e963ae99dbe7090b56c9d95","amp;dn":"Gossip.Girl.S04E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2440d251ca93ebf0e963ae99dbe7090b56c9d95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,68,13,37,28,169,62,191,14,150,58,233,157,190,112,144,181,108,157,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
