Made by Groove Games. Basically the exact same thing as Land of the Dead but with a new single player and a few new features.\n\nstory mode is funner and set up better than lotd too, though the story is kinda weak and stupid. you play as 3 different people: a college student looking for his lady, a college janitor trying to save his school (thinks it's all student pranks), and an army soldier (trying to find civilians i guess).\n\nINSTALLATION:\nExtract\nMount or Burn\nInstall\nPlay (no cracks or serials needed)\n\n\nENJOY AND FREAKING SEED!!!!!\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDon't forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3849cab899ce76122aa39df32d8dae88741a1620","amp;dn":"Day+of+the+Zombie+%28Groove+Games%29+%28just+like+Land+of+the+dead%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3849cab899ce76122aa39df32d8dae88741a1620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,73,202,184,153,206,118,18,42,163,157,243,45,141,174,136,116,26,22,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
