This is his latest album, almost entirely jumpstyle, and it's got a select few good tracks. The ones I recommend from this are Sakura era, UNSTABLE SKY AND OTHERS, which is some really weird intense makina/jumpstyle/hard trancish/ blended with hardcore, and though I normally hate Sharpnel this track is an exception; and Vacuum break, more jumpstyle.\n\nGive it a shot if you like jumpstyle or USAO, hopefully you'll find something to keep in your library.\n\n\n01.
