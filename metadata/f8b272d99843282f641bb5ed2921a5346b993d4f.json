It shows Minogue driving towards a futuristic city and back-up dancers in various futuristic costumes dancing in a highly stylized manner. It then focuses on Minogue in a sporty outfit, after which she is seen with other dancers in a computer-generated futuristic city. Her white, hooded costume, with plunging necklines and revealing slits, was widely discussed both for its fashion style and for Minogue's overt sexual posturing.[citation needed] Lastly, she appears with a curly hairdo in a metal-like costume. In his book La La La, William Baker conceded that the robotic dance within the video was purposely developed to give Minogue an association with a dance the way Madonna had developed an association with Vogueing, he felt that at this stage in her career it was important for Minogue to set trends and not follow them, just as Madonna had before her.\n\nIn 2002, the video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography. It was voted the third best video of all time by viewers of MTV Italy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8b272d99843282f641bb5ed2921a5346b993d4f","amp;dn":"Kylie_Minogue-Can%5C%27t_Get_You_Out_Of_My_Head-DVDRip-x264-2001-MVc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8b272d99843282f641bb5ed2921a5346b993d4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,178,114,217,152,67,40,47,100,27,181,237,41,33,165,52,107,153,61,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
