In a special new game The Boys and Girls     \n    Line Up, teams have to match up three Aussie artists to the three    \n      quirky facts about them. Joining the line-up is opera singer       \n     Antoinette Halloran, Leonardo's Bride Abby Dobson, rock singer      \n    Wendy Stapleton, conductor Benjamin Northey, Uncanny X-Man Brian     \n    Mannix, and Kram from Spiderbait. To close the show Doug Goodman     \n   and Wacca the Gumtree Drummer perform a unique version of Waltzing    \n                                Matilda.                                 \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                    www.abc.net.au/tv/spicksandspecks                    \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                \n             \n                                                                           \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                            \n                                                                    \n                                             \n                                              \n                                                      \n                                                         \n                                    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n                \n                                                                  \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                 Enjoy!!                                 \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                        \n                                                                      \n                                                                        \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                  \n                \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                          \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                            \n                                                                           \n                                                     \n                                      \n                                              \n                                                     \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                             \n                                                                         \n                \n                                                                   \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n           Shell &amp;
