It was written by Ratt vocalist Stephen Pearcy, bassist Juan Croucier, and guitarist Warren DeMartini.\n\nIn the music video for the song, a female freelance reporter named Kitty Galore (an allusion to Ian Fleming's Pussy Galore character) is sent to a Ratt concert to spy on the band for the fictional &quot;Spy Magazine&quot;. Ratt then commences to play at said concert, the music of which compels Kitty Galore to dance along provocatively even while under assignment. The end of the video has Kitty Galore catching a snapshot of Ratt lead vocalist Stephen Pearcy, after which the two suddenly start to make out.\n\nThe hotel room scenes in the video were filmed in Shreveport, Louisiana following a live concert at the historic Hirsch Memorial Coliseum.\n\nDancing Undercover is Ratt's third full length album. It was produced by Beau Hill. The album contained the hits &quot;Dance&quot;, &quot;Slip of the Lip&quot;, and &quot;Body Talk&quot;.\n\nCommercially, the album was a major disappointment, selling considerably less than Ratt's two previous albums. This signaled the beginning of the band's commercial decline, which ultimately lead to Ratt's breakup in 1992.\n\n&quot;Body Talk&quot; was later used on the soundtrack for the Eddie Murphy film, The Golden Child. In 2003 Metal-Rules.com named &quot;Dancing Undercover&quot; number 29 on their &quot;Top 50 Glam metal Albums&quot;.\n\nRatt &amp; Roll 8191 is a compilation album collecting most of the biggest hits from 1983 to 1991 from the American glam-metal band Ratt.
